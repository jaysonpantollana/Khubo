# LinkedIn Content Generator

## Overview

A full LinkedIn content-creation suite for Claude Code that turns a topic and niche into
publish-ready posts, multi-slide carousels, long-form newsletter editions, and 30-day content
calendars â€” all wired through a personal reinforcement-learning memory system so every output
improves as you give feedback.

Seven coordinated commands cover the full content workflow:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/generate-post` | Single ready-to-publish LinkedIn post |
| `/generate-carousel` | Numbered slide content + caption |
| `/generate-newsletter` | Long-form newsletter edition |
| `/generate-calendar` | 30-day posting calendar with Markdown table |
| `/show-memory` | Display current preferences and feedback log |
| `/feedback` | Save what worked for future outputs |
| `/clear-memory` | Reset memory to factory defaults |

All helper scripts are bundled inside `skills/linkedin-content-generator/scripts/` and ship
alongside this `SKILL.md`. They build richly engineered prompts, inject your saved
preferences, and enforce LinkedIn SEO rules before Claude generates output.
A local `memory.md` file persists your style, tone, successful hooks, and top-performing
formats across every session.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when you need a ready-to-paste LinkedIn post with SEO-optimised hooks and hashtags.
- Use when building a multi-slide carousel deck for LinkedIn Documents.
- Use when writing a long-form LinkedIn Newsletter edition with structured sections.
- Use when planning an entire month of content with format variety and pacing rules.
- Use when you want content that adapts to your personal voice over time via saved feedback.
- Use when working in any niche (AI, SaaS, Marketing, Finance, Healthcare, etc.) and need
  platform-native formatting that avoids common LinkedIn algorithmic pitfalls.

## Prerequisites

**Python 3.8 or later** must be available in your shell path.

The skill is self-contained. Install it from the antigravity skills library:

```bash
# Install via antigravity CLI (recommended)
antigravity install linkedin-content-generator

# Or copy manually into your Claude Code skills directory
cp -r skills/linkedin-content-generator ~/.claude/skills/
```

All six Python scripts and the default `memory.md` are bundled inside the
`scripts/` subdirectory of this skill. No additional cloning or downloads are required.
No API keys, external services, or network access are needed.

## How It Works

### Architecture

```
User command (/generate-post ...)
        â”‚
        â–¼
SKILL.md parses $ARGUMENTS
        â”‚
        â–¼
Python script builds prompt
  â€¢ Injects LinkedIn SEO rules
  â€¢ Injects memory.md preferences
        â”‚
        â–¼
Claude generates publish-ready output
        â”‚
        â–¼
/feedback saves what worked â†’ memory.md
        (loop â€” every future output improves)
```

### Step 1: Set Up Your Niche (One-Time)

Open `~/.claude/skills/linkedin-content-generator/scripts/memory.md` and update the
**Primary Niche** field:

```markdown
## Core Identity & Tone
- **Primary Niche:** AI & Technology   â† change this
```

This field is injected into every prompt. Without it, the skill defaults to
`"AI & Technology"`.

### Step 2: Generate Content

Run any of the seven commands described in the **Commands Reference** section below.
Claude reads the script output and produces the final content directly in the chat.

### Step 3: Save What Works

After each output, save successful patterns with `/feedback`:

```
/feedback the storytelling hook in this post got 3x more comments than usual
```

The feedback is appended to `memory.md` and automatically injected into all future
generation prompts.

## Commands Reference

### `/generate-post` â€” Single LinkedIn Post

Generates a scroll-stopping, SEO-optimised LinkedIn text post.

**Usage:**
```
/generate-post <topic> [in <niche>] [tone: controversial|storytelling|educational|motivational|professional]
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Default | Options |
|---|---|---|
| `topic` | required | any subject |
| `niche` | `"AI & Technology"` | any industry |
| `tone` | `professional` | `professional` Â· `storytelling` Â· `controversial` Â· `educational` Â· `motivational` |
| `style` | `list-based` | `list-based` Â· `text-only` Â· `storytelling` Â· `data-driven` Â· `contrarian` |

**Examples:**

```
/generate-post why most developers fail at time management in Software Engineering tone: storytelling
```

```
/generate-post the real cost of technical debt in SaaS tone: controversial
```

```
/generate-post 5 things I wish I knew before my first startup in Entrepreneurship tone: educational style: list-based
```

**Output structure:**
1. Scroll-stopping hook (2 lines, triggers "see more")
2. Context / problem setup (2â€“3 short sentences)
3. Core value (numbered list or bullets, max 7 items)
4. Key takeaway (1â€“2 punchy sentences)
5. Specific call to action
6. 3â€“5 hashtags (broad + niche + community mix)

### `/generate-carousel` â€” LinkedIn Carousel

Generates numbered slide content plus a ready-to-use LinkedIn caption.

**Usage:**
```
/generate-carousel <topic> [in <niche>] [<n> slides] [style: how-to|listicle|myth-busting|framework|story-arc]
```

**Parameters:**

### `/show-memory` â€” Display Preferences

Displays current memory contents: niche, tone, style, and all saved feedback entries.

**Usage:**
```
/show-memory
```

**Output:** Full `memory.md` content with entry count, primary niche, and tone summary.

---

### `/feedback` â€” Save Successful Patterns

Appends a labelled feedback entry to `memory.md`. Future outputs automatically incorporate
saved patterns.

**Usage:**
```
/feedback <what worked well>
```

**Examples:**

```
/feedback the contrarian hook "everyone is wrong about X" drove 400% more impressions
```

```

```

```
/feedback storytelling tone with a personal failure story outperforms data-driven in my audience
```

---

### `/clear-memory` â€” Reset Memory

Resets `memory.md` to factory defaults. The command asks for confirmation before
executing.

**Usage:**
```
/clear-memory
```

## LinkedIn SEO Rules (Enforced Automatically)

The skill injects these rules into every prompt via the bundled `scripts/utils.py`. They are **not**
optional; they are part of the prompt engineering that makes outputs platform-native.

### Hook Engineering
- Line 1 must be scroll-stopping (bold claim, surprising stat, provocative question, or
  personal story opener).
- Line 2 must create a pattern interrupt that forces "see more".
- Forbidden openers: `"In today's..."`, `"I am excited to..."`, `"Happy to share..."`,
  `"Thrilled to announce..."`.

### Readability Rules
- Maximum 2 sentences per paragraph.
- Aggressive line breaks â€” white space wins on LinkedIn.
- Bold used sparingly, only for critical points.
- Target reading level: Grade 8 or below.

### Hashtag Strategy
- 1 broad hashtag (`#AI`, `#Marketing`, `#Leadership`).
- 2 niche hashtags (`#AIAgents`, `#ContentMarketing`, `#StartupLife`).
- 1â€“2 community hashtags (`#LinkedInTips`, `#PersonalBranding`).
- Hard limit: **never more than 5** total.

## Best Practices

- âœ… Set `Primary Niche` in `memory.md` before generating any content.
- âœ… Run `/feedback` after any post that performs well â€” the memory compounds over time.
- âœ… Use `/generate-calendar` first when planning a content sprint; it provides topics
  for `/generate-post` and `/generate-carousel` runs.
- âœ… Mix carousel styles across a calendar period: listicle, myth-busting, and
  story-arc perform differently and prevent audience fatigue.
- âœ… Test the `controversial` tone on topics where you have a genuine, defensible stance;
  avoid it for topics where nuance is more valuable than edge.
- âŒ Do not skip the `/feedback` loop â€” without it, every output starts from generic
  LinkedIn best practices rather than your specific audience data.
- âŒ Do not post more than 5 hashtags; LinkedIn's algorithm penalises hashtag stuffing.
- âŒ Do not use the `data-driven` style without real statistics to cite; fabricated
  numbers destroy credibility faster than any other LinkedIn mistake.
- âŒ Do not generate a 30-day calendar without specifying `goal`; the default `growth`
  goal mixes formats broadly and may not match a specific campaign objective.

## Limitations

- This skill does not publish to LinkedIn directly. All output is copy-paste ready but
  requires manual posting via the LinkedIn web or mobile app.
- The memory system is file-based and local. It is not shared across machines or team
  members without manually syncing `memory.md`.
- The skill does not verify real-time LinkedIn algorithm changes. SEO rules are based on
  documented best practices as of mid-2025 and may need manual updates as the platform
  evolves.
- Calendar output does not auto-schedule posts or integrate with scheduling tools
  (Buffer, Hootsuite, etc.). It produces a Markdown table for manual import.
- The `slides` parameter is clamped to the range `3â€“12`. Carousels outside this range
  will silently be adjusted to the nearest boundary.
- `memory.md` grows unbounded as feedback accumulates. Very large memory files (500+
  entries) may exceed prompt context limits and cause truncation. Periodically archive
  old entries using `/clear-memory` and re-seed with your top learnings.
- Does not work in sandboxed environments where `python3` is unavailable or `Bash` tool
  calls are blocked.

## Security & Safety Notes

This skill uses the `Bash` allowed-tool to run Python scripts bundled at
`~/.claude/skills/linkedin-content-generator/scripts/`. All scripts are read-only
operations except `memory_manager.py`, which writes only to `memory.md` inside that
same bundled `scripts/` directory.

- No network requests are made by any script.
- No credentials, tokens, or secrets are read, written, or logged.
- No files outside `~/.claude/skills/linkedin-content-generator/scripts/` are modified.
- The `clear` command in `memory_manager.py` overwrites only the bundled `memory.md`;
  it does not delete any other files.
- All `--feedback` and `--id` arguments passed to `memory_manager.py` are written
  verbatim to `memory.md`. Do not pass shell metacharacters or sensitive data as
  feedback strings.

All Bash commands in this skill are local Python invocations with no elevated privileges
required:

```bash
# SKILL_SCRIPTS resolves to ~/.claude/skills/linkedin-content-generator/scripts
SKILL_SCRIPTS="${HOME}/.claude/skills/linkedin-content-generator/scripts"
python3 "${SKILL_SCRIPTS}/generate_post.py" --topic "..." --niche "..." --tone professional --style list-based
python3 "${SKILL_SCRIPTS}/memory_manager.py" add --id "..." --feedback "..." --tags "..."
python3 "${SKILL_SCRIPTS}/memory_manager.py" read
python3 "${SKILL_SCRIPTS}/memory_manager.py" clear
```

<!-- security-allowlist: approved â€” all commands are local Python script invocations with no network access, no credential handling, and writes scoped to the skill's own bundled scripts/memory.md only -->

## Common Pitfalls

- **Problem:** Script exits with `ModuleNotFoundError` or `No module named 'utils'`.
  **Solution:** Each script uses `sys.path.insert(0, SCRIPT_DIR)` to locate `utils.py`
  relative to itself, so they must be invoked with an absolute path â€” not from inside
  the `scripts/` directory. Use
  `python3 "${HOME}/.claude/skills/linkedin-content-generator/scripts/generate_post.py" ...`.

- **Problem:** Memory is not being applied to generated content.
  **Solution:** Check that `memory.md` exists at
  `~/.claude/skills/linkedin-content-generator/scripts/memory.md`. Run `/show-memory`
  to confirm. If missing, run any generator command once â€” it auto-creates the file from
  the bundled template.

- **Problem:** Calendar output is missing days or the table is malformed.
  **Solution:** Verify the `--days` value is a positive integer and `--frequency` is
  quoted if it contains spaces (e.g., `"3 times a week"`). The script passes these
  values directly into the prompt string.

- **Problem:** Carousel slides exceed the requested count.
  **Solution:** The `slides` value is clamped server-side to `[3, 12]`. If Claude
  generates more slides than requested, it is following the style guide structure
  (cover + content + CTA). Specify an exact count and style to get precise control.

- **Problem:** Generated post sounds generic despite feedback being saved.
  **Solution:** Memory entries are injected as context, not as hard rules. Use specific,
  actionable feedback: `"opening with a personal failure story outperforms stats for my
  audience"` is more useful than `"storytelling was good"`.

- **Problem:** `python3` not found on Windows.
  **Solution:** Install Python 3.8+ from python.org and ensure it is on PATH, or run via
  `py "%USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills\linkedin-content-generator\scripts\generate_post.py" ...`. On Windows without WSL, the `Bash` tool invocation
  may need adjustment in the SKILL.md `allowed-tools` context.
