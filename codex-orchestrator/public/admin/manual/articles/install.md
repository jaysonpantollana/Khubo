Orchestrator ships as a Docker Compose stack: the Node API, MySQL 8.4, the auth runner, and Caddy as the TLS/reverse proxy. `bin/setup.sh` walks you through first-time configuration and brings up the stack.

## Stack overview

Four services are defined in `docker-compose.yml`:

| Service | Image | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `api` | Node/Fastify | Listens on `127.0.0.1:8488` (host) → `8080` (container). Runs read-only with all capabilities dropped. |
| `mysql` | `mysql:8.4` | **MySQL 8.4**, not MariaDB. Data stored under `<DATA_ROOT>/mysql_data`. |
| `auth-runner` | Python sidecar | Receives `RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET` (separate from the API-side `AUTH_RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET`). |
| `caddy` | Caddy | **Profile-gated** (`profiles: ["caddy"]`). Not started by default. |

`DATA_ROOT` defaults to `/var/docker_data/codex-auth.example.com`. Change it in `.env` before first boot. The internal Docker network `codex_auth` uses subnet `172.30.250.0/24` by default; override with `CODEX_AUTH_SUBNET` and `CODEX_AUTH_GATEWAY`.

### Starting Caddy

Because Caddy is behind the `caddy` profile, it does **not** start with a plain `docker compose up -d`. To include it:

```bash
docker compose --profile caddy up -d
```

## First boot

1. **Clone and run setup.** `bin/setup.sh` prompts for `.env` values (public base URL, admin access mode, runner secret, TLS material), writes `.env` in the repo root, and calls `docker compose up -d`.
2. **Schema.** The Drizzle schema in `api/src/db/schema.ts` is the single source of truth. Migrations are applied manually with `drizzle-kit` (`npm run drizzle:generate` / `drizzle:push` from `api/`) outside the running app. `RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_BOOT` and `RUN_BACKFILLS_ON_BOOT` are declared in `api/src/env.ts` but nothing in the current boot path (`api/src/server.ts`, `api/src/ops/boot-checks.ts`) reads either flag — setting them has no effect today, so always run migrations yourself before or after deploying.
3. **No admins, no gating.** While `AdminAuthService.isEnforced()` returns false (i.e. `admin_users` is empty), the admin UI serves the first-run screens that let you create the initial admin. The moment you create one, session enforcement flips on for everyone.
4. **Wrapper signing key.** Run `scripts/wrapper-v2-init-keys.sh` once per environment to generate the Ed25519 keypair used to sign per-host wrapper configs. The keypair is stored in the `wrapper_signing_keys` table by `wrapper-signing-key.ts`. Then `cd wrappers && make pubkey` embeds the public key into the Go binaries at build time.

## Environment variables the app reads

These are the variables consumed by `api/src/env.ts`. The file is parsed with Zod; process environment always wins over any `.env` file.

### Hard requirements (fail-fast)

- **Either `ENCRYPTION_ACTIVE_KEY` or `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be set.** Both accept 32 raw bytes, base64-encoded. The app refuses to start if neither is present. Back these up carefully — losing them destroys all encrypted auth payloads.
- `AUTH_RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET` is required when `AUTH_RUNNER_URL` is set.
- `ADMIN_WEBAUTHN_ORIGIN` is required when `ADMIN_WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` is set.

### Core

- `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` — canonical base URL the installer script embeds in the bootstrap transition launcher.
- `PUBLIC_BASE_URL_REQUIRED` — bool, default `true`. Fails startup if `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is missing.
- `ADMIN_ACCESS_MODE` — `mtls` (default), `cookie`, or `open`.
- `ADMIN_SESSION_COOKIE` — default `codex_admin_session`.
- `ADMIN_SESSION_TTL_MINUTES` — default `43200` (30 days) in `env.ts`. `AdminAuthService.sessionTtlSeconds()` clamps this to 5 min – 7 days at login, so a fresh session starts at 7 days; `auth-admin.ts`'s `resolveAdmin` then rolls `expiresAt` forward on every authenticated request using the same TTL clamped to 5 min – 30 days, so an actively used session keeps renewing out to 30 days.
- `ADMIN_WEBAUTHN_RP_ID`, `ADMIN_WEBAUTHN_ORIGIN`, `ADMIN_WEBAUTHN_RP_NAME` — passkey relying-party metadata.
- `ADMIN_WS_ENABLED` — defaults to `false` in env.ts, but **the compose file sets it to `1` (enabled) by default** when using the compose stack. Also: `ADMIN_WS_PUBLIC_URL`, `ADMIN_WS_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS`, `ADMIN_WS_BACKLOG_LIMIT`.
- `INSTALLATION_ID` — optional installation identifier.

### Auth runner

- `AUTH_RUNNER_URL`, `AUTH_RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET` — how the API reaches the Python runner. **Note:** the compose file passes `RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET` to the `auth-runner` container; `AUTH_RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET` is what the API reads. These are separate variables for different services.
- `AUTH_RUNNER_CODEX_BASE_URL` — Codex auth base URL for the runner.
- `AUTH_RUNNER_TIMEOUT` — default `8` (seconds). HTTP timeout used for calls to the runner (health checks, verify, exec).
- `AUTH_RUNNER_VERIFY_TTL_SECONDS` — default `900`. How stale a canonical auth's stored verification verdict may get before the background auth-verification worker re-checks it.
- `AUTH_RUNNER_VERIFY_WORKER_INTERVAL_SECONDS` — default `300`. Poll interval for the background worker (`api/src/ops/auth-verification-worker.ts`, started from `server.ts`) that replaced synchronous runner verification on the request/boot path.
- `AUTH_RUNNER_IP_BYPASS` — bool, default `false`. Bypass runner IP checks.
- `AUTH_RUNNER_BYPASS_SUBNETS` — subnets exempt from runner IP checks (used when `AUTH_RUNNER_IP_BYPASS` is true).
- `AUTH_RUNNER_PREFLIGHT_SECONDS` — still declared in `env.ts` (default `28800`) but no longer read anywhere in `api/src`; superseded by `AUTH_RUNNER_VERIFY_TTL_SECONDS` / `AUTH_RUNNER_VERIFY_WORKER_INTERVAL_SECONDS` above.

### Encryption / keyring

- `ENCRYPTION_ACTIVE_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_KEYS`, `ENCRYPTION_ACTIVE_KID` — key material for `api/src/security/keyring.ts`. Legacy `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_*` variants are accepted.
- `AUTH_SEED_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS` — default `900`. TTL for single-use seed tokens.

### Database

- `DB_CHARSET` — default `utf8mb4`.
- `DB_POOL_SIZE` — default `10`.

### Proxy / host validation

- `TRUST_X_FORWARDED` — trust the `X-Forwarded-*` headers from upstream proxies.
- `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` — CIDRs of trusted proxies.
- `STRICT_HOST_VALIDATION` — bool, default `true`.
- `MCP_ALLOW_REQUEST_HOST_ORIGIN` — bool, default `false`.
- `INSECURE_GRACE_MINUTES` — default `60`. Grace window for insecure hosts.

### Storage / sync

- `DATA_ROOT` — overrides the default storage layout. Wrapper binaries live under `<DATA_ROOT>/wrapper/v2/bin/...` (or `storage/wrapper/v2/bin/...` relative to the repo root when unset).
- `CODEX_SYNC_BASE_URL` — override sync base URL.

### Boot behaviour

- `RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_BOOT` — bool, default `false`. Declared in `env.ts` but currently unread by the boot path (`server.ts`, `ops/boot-checks.ts`); has no effect. Apply migrations manually with `drizzle-kit`.
- `RUN_BACKFILLS_ON_BOOT` — bool, default `false`. Same status as above: declared but not currently consumed anywhere in `api/src`.

### MCP

- `MCP_OPERATOR_TOKEN`, `MCP_FS_ROOT`, `MCP_FS_MAX_*` — MCP operator bearer + filesystem tool root (see [mcp](/admin/manual/mcp)).

### Mailer

- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_FROM`, `SMTP_SECURE` — optional mailer; password reset flows are inert without these.

### Misc

- `DEFAULT_HOST_ENGINES` — `codex`, `claude`, or `codex,claude`; default when registering.

### Pricing

- `GPT51_INPUT_PER_1K`, `GPT51_OUTPUT_PER_1K` (and other `GPT51_*` variants)
- `CHATGPT_PLUS_PLAN_COST`, `CHATGPT_PRO_PLAN_COST`
- `CHATGPT_USAGE_CRON_INTERVAL`, `CHATGPT_BASE_URL`, `CHATGPT_USAGE_TIMEOUT`
- `CLAUDE_OPUS_INPUT_PER_1K`, `CLAUDE_OPUS_OUTPUT_PER_1K`, `CLAUDE_SONNET_INPUT_PER_1K`, `CLAUDE_SONNET_OUTPUT_PER_1K`, `CLAUDE_HAIKU_INPUT_PER_1K`, `CLAUDE_HAIKU_OUTPUT_PER_1K`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — parsed by `env.ts`, but currently unused elsewhere in `api/src`; there is no `claude-usage.ts` service consuming them yet (only `chatgpt-usage.ts` is wired up).
- `PRICING_URL`, `PRICING_CURRENCY`

Check `.env.example` in the repo for the full, current list.

## Caddy configuration

Caddy is configured via `caddy/Caddyfile`. The domain is set with `$CADDY_DOMAIN`. TLS is imported from a fragment file selected by `$CADDY_TLS_FRAGMENT`:

- `tls-acme.caddy` — Let's Encrypt ACME
- `tls-custom.caddy` — custom certificate files (paths configured via `$CADDY_TLS_DIR`)

**mTLS is enforced at the Caddy layer**, not by the Node API alone. For `/admin*` paths, Caddy requires a valid client certificate before forwarding the request. Requests without a client cert receive a `403` response from Caddy directly. On successful cert verification, Caddy injects `X-MTLS-Present`, `X-MTLS-Fingerprint`, `X-MTLS-Subject`, and `X-MTLS-Issuer` headers upstream. The admin WebSocket at `/admin/ws` is behind the same mTLS gate. All other paths are plain reverse-proxied to the API.

Client certificates and CA material are configured via `$CADDY_MTLS_DIR`.

## Seeding the canonical auth

Hosts cannot fetch auth until the orchestrator has its own copy. Two paths:

- **Admin UI upload.** Sign in as the first admin, use *Admin → Upload auth*. The route is `POST /admin/auth/upload`. This is the normal path once you are running.
- **Seed auth token.** `POST /admin/auth/seed-command` mints a single-use token, backed by an `auth_seed_tokens` row. The generated `curl | bash` snippet is copied automatically; the admin runs it on the machine that currently holds the canonical `~/.codex/auth.json`. The seed endpoint is `POST /seed/auth/{token}` (aliased to `/seed/v2/auth/{token}`). Tokens are UUIDs and are consumed on success. Token TTL is controlled by `AUTH_SEED_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS` (default 900 s).

The GET twin at `/seed/auth/{token}` returns an executable shell script that reads your local `auth.json` and POSTs it back.

## Registering a host

`POST /admin/hosts/register` creates a host row and returns a one-shot installer token. The token is stored in `install_tokens` and consumed by `GET /install/{token}` (aliased to `/install/v2/{token}`). The install endpoint emits the per-host POSIX shell installer. It installs `cdx`, `clx`, or both into `/usr/local/bin` by default (root/passwordless `sudo` required; `BIN_DIR` is the explicit custom-prefix override). The admin sees a `curl … | sh` command under *Hosts → New Host*.

What the installer actually does on the target machine:

1. Fetches each signed per-host config and its platform-specific Go wrapper,
   verifies SHA-256, and installs the wrapper into the selected bin directory.
2. When Claude is requested, prepares Node.js/npm first. It prefers the OS Node
   runtime plus a pinned Corepack npm shim and falls back to the OS npm package.
3. Runs each requested wrapper's managed cron/bootstrap path once with minimal
   output and peer recursion suppressed, installing Codex and/or Claude Code at
   the server-selected version.
4. Prints `READY` only after every wrapper, CLI, and cron entry verifies. Any
   partial failure prints `INCOMPLETE`, exits non-zero, and gives a direct retry;
   wrapper/config failures require minting a fresh single-use installer.

## Wrapper distribution

Canonical wrapper sources are the Go modules under `wrappers/cdx/` and `wrappers/clx/`. CI cross-compiles per platform and writes results to `<DATA_ROOT>/wrapper/v2/bin/<engine>/<os>-<arch>/`, with a `manifest.json` per platform listing builds and their SHA256s; `wrapper-bin-registry.ts` discovers them. `GET /wrapper` (aliased to `/wrapper/v2/meta`) returns the per-platform manifest; `GET /wrapper/download` returns the bootstrap transition launcher for the calling host. Hosts use these endpoints to self-update between runs.

## Post-install smoke test

- From the admin UI, visit *Dashboard*. New hosts appear under *Hosts → Unprovisioned* until they complete a successful sync; after that they move to *Secure* (or *Insecure*, if you activated insecure mode on registration). Use the **Runner state** card's **Run verification** button (one per engine) to confirm the runner is reachable; it calls `POST /admin/runner/run` for Codex or `/admin/runner/run-claude` for Claude.
- Click into any host to see its per-host baked config version, last auth digest, and IP binding state.

## Backups

There is no built-in backup job. Back up:

1. The MySQL volume (`docker-compose.yml` names the data volume for you).
2. The encryption keyring referenced by `Keyring` (the values in `ENCRYPTION_KEYS` / `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEYS`).
3. The wrapper signing key — held in the `wrapper_signing_keys` table. Rotating it requires every host to self-update; losing it requires re-issuing the key and re-deploying binaries.

Without the encryption keys you cannot decrypt `auth_payloads`. The app will still run, but every host will fail sync until a fresh canonical auth is re-uploaded.
