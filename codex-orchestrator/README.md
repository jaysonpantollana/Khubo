# Codex Orchestrator

**One command to rule your AI fleet — Codex and Claude, side by side.**

Codex Orchestrator is a self-hosted PHP/MySQL service that keeps OpenAI Codex and Anthropic Claude Code running smoothly across every machine you own. Upload your auth once, register your hosts, and let `cdx` (Codex) and `clx` (Claude) handle the rest — syncing credentials, config, skills, and usage data while serving everything canonically through MCP so you never have to copy a token by hand again.

A host can run Codex, Claude, or both. The orchestrator manages both engines from a single admin dashboard.

> **Claude Code support is in beta.** Codex (`cdx`) is the mature, battle-tested path. Claude Code (`clx`) — native account-login auth, on-disk skill sync, and the `/anthropic/v1/` proxy — is newer and still stabilizing. Expect the occasional rough edge and fleet binary bump; please report anything that breaks.

*`cdx` verifies fleet policy, auth, versions, quota, skills, and MCP before handing control to Codex.*

## What does it actually do?

**Multi-engine fleet management**
- Deploy **Codex** (`cdx`) and/or **Claude Code** (`clx`) on any host — each gets its own wrapper but shares the same API key.
- Skills, AGENTS.md, and MCP memories are shared across both engines by default.
- Engine-specific config: `config.toml` for Codex, `settings.json` for Claude.

**Sync everything, everywhere**
- Auth credentials, config, slash commands, and agent documents stay in sync across every host — automatically, every time you run `cdx` or `clx`.
- Skills are served canonically through MCP `skill://{slug}` resources instead of per-host local copies.
- Each host gets its own API key baked right into the wrapper. No shared secrets floating around.

**Stay safe without thinking about it**
- Auth payloads are encrypted at rest. API keys are hashed and IP-bound on first use.
- Hosts you don't trust to keep credentials on disk? Mark them "insecure" — auth is purged after the last overlapping auth-aware wrapper process exits.
- A global kill switch lets you cut API access fleet-wide in seconds if something goes sideways.

**See what's happening**
- Track fleet health, sync activity, and ChatGPT quota windows with built-in dashboards.
- Quota warnings nudge you before you hit limits. VIP hosts can bypass them when it matters.
- ChatGPT quota snapshots refresh automatically so you always know where you stand.

**Stay in control**
- Pin Codex or Claude to a specific version fleet-wide, or let individual hosts override.
- Both `cdx` and `clx` wrappers self-update from your server — no manual upgrades.
- An admin dashboard covers host management, engine selection, content editing, usage monitoring, and more.

**Expose compatible APIs**
- The built-in `/v1/` endpoints speak the OpenAI protocol — point any OpenAI SDK client at your orchestrator.
- The `/anthropic/v1/` endpoints speak the Anthropic protocol — point any Anthropic SDK client at your orchestrator.
- Manage API keys (`sk-coco-` prefix) from the admin dashboard with per-key rate limits and expiration.

**Collaborate across agents**
- The optional Projects module gives your agents shared notes, todos, files, and feedback with append-only change history.
- A native MCP server provides host-scoped memory tools plus shared project resources — accessible from both Codex and Claude.

## Codex vs Claude: feature matrix

Legend: ✅ supported · 🅱️ beta · — not supported

| Capability | Codex (`cdx`) | Claude (`clx`) |
|---|---|---|
| Daily-driver wrapper | ✅ | 🅱️ |
| Auth sync (account-login) | ✅ `auth.json` | 🅱️ native `claudeAiOauth` |
| Config sync | ✅ `config.toml` | 🅱️ `settings.json` (deep-merge, keeps your keys) |
| Per-host API key + IP binding | ✅ | ✅ |
| Wrapper self-update & version pinning | ✅ | ✅ |
| Shared skills | ✅ via MCP `skill://` | 🅱️ on-disk `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Agent doc sync | ✅ `AGENTS.md` | ✅ `CLAUDE.md` (shared pipeline) |
| MCP memory & project tools | ✅ | ✅ |
| Usage / token tracking | ✅ | ✅ |
| Insecure-host purge & kill switch | ✅ | ✅ |
| Compatible passthrough API | ✅ `/v1/` (OpenAI) | ✅ `/anthropic/v1/` (Anthropic) |
| ChatGPT quota snapshots & warnings | ✅ | — (native API limits only) |
| Lanes & profiles (`lane`, `profile`) | ✅ | — |
| Native collections (subagents / commands / output-styles) | — | 🅱️ |
| Advisor model (experimental reviewer) | — | 🅱️ `advisorModel` (opus/sonnet/haiku) |

The core fleet machinery — auth, config, per-host keys, skills, MCP memory, usage, and the safety controls — is at parity across both engines. The 🅱️ rows are the newer Claude paths that are still stabilizing. Quota snapshots and lanes/profiles are Codex-only; Claude's native on-disk collections (subagents, commands, output-styles) have no Codex analogue.

## Is this for me?

You'll get the most out of this if:

- You run Codex and/or Claude Code on **more than one machine** and want a single source of truth for auth and config.
- You want **per-host API keys** with IP binding, instead of one token pasted everywhere.
- You need **visibility** into who's using what across both engines, which hosts and engines are using tokens, and a way to set limits.
- You'd like to manage **skills and agent documents** from one place instead of scattering files across machines.
- You want a **kill switch** and quota controls you can pull from a dashboard.
- You want **OpenAI and Anthropic compatible APIs** you can point third-party tools at without exposing your real API keys.

If you only use one AI tool on one laptop, this is probably overkill — but we won't judge if you set it up anyway.

## Get started in 5 minutes

All you need is Docker and Docker Compose.

```bash
bin/setup.sh
```

That's it. The guided installer walks you through `.env` configuration, data directories, TLS setup, and (unless you opt out) builds and starts the whole stack. See [`docs/INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md) for non-interactive flags and advanced options.

### Onboard your first host

1. **Upload your auth** — go to Admin and upload your canonical `~/.codex/auth.json`. You only do this once.
2. **Register a host** — Admin, Hosts, New Host. You'll get an installer command.
3. **Run the installer** on the target machine:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-server/install/<token> | bash
   ```
4. **Done.** Codex hosts run `cdx`, Claude hosts run `clx`, and dual-engine hosts get both in one install.

Secure hosts keep auth on disk and work offline (24h fresh window, 7d fallback).
On insecure hosts, every auth-aware cdx/clx invocation shares a session lease;
the last exiting process purges native credentials while preserving explicit
logout intent. An open admin window is required for the next retrieve.

## Day-to-day: the `cdx` command

Once a host is provisioned, `cdx` is your daily driver:

```bash
cdx                              # sync and launch with fleet defaults
cdx myprofile                    # use a named profile from config.toml
cdx --execute "show me open PRs" # one-shot, script-friendly output
```

A few more handy ones:

```bash
cdx status          # quick health check
cdx doctor          # diagnose SSH, PTY, and API issues
cdx auth-upload     # upload current ~/.codex/auth.json after codex login
cdx lane spark      # switch to Spark lane for this run
cdx ls              # shortcut for lane spark
cdx --update        # force-update the wrapper and Codex
cdx --uninstall     # remove everything and decommission
```

## OpenAI-compatible API

The orchestrator exposes an OpenAI-compatible REST API at `/v1/`. Any tool that speaks the OpenAI protocol (SDKs, CLI clients, IDE plugins) can use it.

1. **Create a key** in Admin > API access.
2. **Point your client** at the orchestrator:
   ```python
   import openai
   client = openai.OpenAI(
       base_url="https://your-server/v1",
       api_key="sk-coco-...",
   )
   response = client.chat.completions.create(
       model="cdx-lm-1",
       messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
   )
   ```

Supported endpoints: `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/models`. Embeddings returns a `not_implemented` error. Streaming (`stream: true`) sends a single SSE frame with the full response.

## Under the hood

Codex Orchestrator takes security seriously so you can focus on building things:

- **Encryption**: All auth payloads use libsodium secretbox. Keys are rotated with KID tracking.
- **Runner validation**: A sidecar service validates auth before writes are accepted — transparent to reads.
- **Rate limiting**: All non-admin routes are rate-limited, with a dedicated bucket for auth failures.
- **mTLS admin access**: The admin API defaults to mutual TLS. Passkey (WebAuthn) login is available too.
- **IP binding**: Each host's API key locks to its IP on first use, with optional roaming support.

For the full API surface, MCP details, and architecture deep-dive, check the docs below.

## Memory management

Every host gets its own scoped memory store, exposed through MCP tools so agents can persist and recall knowledge across sessions.

- **Store, search, retrieve** — agents use `memory_store`, `memory_search`, and `memory_retrieve` MCP tools. Content is full-text indexed and taggable.
- **Scoped by host** — each host's memories are isolated. Admins can search across all hosts from the dashboard.
- **Auto-summarized** — when a memory changes, the runner generates a one-line summary so agents can scan what's available without reading every entry.
- **Injected into AGENTS.md** — recent memories (up to 50) are dynamically injected into each host's synced AGENTS.md, giving agents instant context on what they've previously stored.
- **Admin dashboard** — browse, search, and delete memories at `/admin/mcp/memories`.

## Skill management

Skills are slash-command manifests stored centrally and served canonically through MCP — no more copying files between machines.

- **Canonical via MCP** — agents access skills through `skill://{slug}` resources. The wrapper cleans up legacy per-host skill directories automatically.
- **Admin authoring** — create, edit, and delete skills from `/admin/skills`. Descriptions and drafts can be AI-generated via the runner.
- **Integrity tracking** — every skill carries a SHA256 hash so the sync pipeline knows when content has actually changed.
- **Injected into AGENTS.md** — published skills with their descriptions are listed in a dynamic section inside each host's AGENTS.md, so agents always know what's available.

## Dynamic AGENTS.md

AGENTS.md is version-controlled on the server and dynamically assembled at sync time with injected sections for skills and memories.

- **Versioned** — every save creates a new immutable version. The admin can revert to any previous version or lock serving to a specific one.
- **Serve modes** — `latest` always serves the newest version; `locked` pins to a chosen version. Per-host overrides are supported.
- **Dynamic injection** — when a host pulls AGENTS.md, the server splices in two managed sections (wrapped in `<!-- cdx:skills:start/end -->` and `<!-- cdx:memories:start/end -->` markers):
  - A **Skills** listing of all published skill slugs and descriptions.
  - A **Memories** listing of recent host-scoped memories with summaries.
- **Change detection** — the wrapper sends its local SHA256; the server responds with `unchanged` (skip write) or `updated` (atomic file replace). Three hashes are tracked: base document, managed sections, and final combined.
- **Seeded on boot** — if the database is empty, the server seeds from the repo's `AGENTS.md` file on first start.
- **Admin dashboard** — edit inline, view version history, control serve mode, and preview the fully rendered document with injections at `/admin/agents`.
