# skill-issue â€” skill activation audit

## Overview

A coding agent decides which skill to run from each skill's always-on `name` +
`description`. A skill can be perfectly implemented and still never fire because
its description is too vague to match how people phrase requests, or because a
more specific sibling silently wins. `skill-issue` audits exactly that surface,
grading each skill Aâ€“F, simulating which skill fires for a given prompt, and
reporting collision clusters where one skill shadows another.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when a skill you wrote never seems to trigger and you don't know why
- Use when the user says "why isn't my skill firing", "which skill fires for X", or "audit my skills"
- Use after writing or installing a new SKILL.md, to confirm it will actually be picked
- Use in CI to fail a PR that adds a skill with empty/duplicate/colliding metadata

## How It Works

Install the CLI (`npm i -g @misha_misha/skill-issue`, `brew install mishanefedov/skill-issue/skill-issue`, or `npx @misha_misha/skill-issue`), then:

```bash
skill-issue ~/.claude/skills                       # grade every skill Aâ€“F (+ collisions summary)
skill-issue ~/.codex/skills --why "deploy to prod" # which skill fires for this prompt, and why
skill-issue <dir> --collisions                     # clusters of skills that shadow each other
skill-issue <dir> --fix                            # append a "Use when â€¦" clause to weak descriptions
skill-issue <dir> --json                           # machine-readable; exits non-zero on errors
```

Offline heuristic by default; add `--llm` to judge with a local `claude`/`codex` CLI.

## Examples

### Example 1: Audit installed skills

```bash
skill-issue ~/.claude/skills
# F  deploy-helper  âœ— no description â€” can never fire
# C  shipit         ! no "use when â€¦" trigger clause
# A  rollback-prod  âœ“ will fire on its triggers
```

### Example 2: Diagnose a collision

```bash
skill-issue ~/.claude/skills --why "deploy the app to prod"
#  1. shipit       0.74  â† would fire
#  2. land-deploy  0.69  (margin 0.05 â€” ambiguous, likely collision)
```

## Limitations

- Offline scoring is heuristic and should be treated as a triage signal, not a final quality verdict.
- Collision reports highlight likely shadowing, but agent-specific routers can weight metadata differently.
- The `--fix` mode can improve weak trigger wording, but generated edits still need maintainer review before committing.
