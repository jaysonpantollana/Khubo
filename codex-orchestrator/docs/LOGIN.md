# Admin Login & Roles

## Summary
- Admin login uses a dedicated route at `/admin/login`.
- Login/session enforcement starts when at least one **active** admin user exists (`access_level=admin`, `active=1`).
- When no active admins exist, admin routes run in bootstrap mode (no login/session enforcement).
- Login uses an HTTP-only session cookie with a configurable TTL.
- Admin login is normally username-first: the page submits the entered username before deciding whether the user must complete passkey auth or may continue to password entry. When exactly one active user exists and has passkeys, it can open that user's passkey prompt directly.
- With `ADMIN_ACCESS_MODE=mtls` (default), passkey login still sits inside the mTLS gate; it does not replace the outer client-cert boundary.
- Password recovery is available from the login screen and completes on the standalone `/admin/password/reset` page.
- Roles control which admin features each user can access.

## Bootstrap & Enforcement
- Enforcement check is the `isEnforced()` helper in `api/src/services/admin-auth.ts` (`countAdmins(true) > 0`).
- When `admin_users` has no active admins: session/capability checks are bypassed for admin API routes, and dashboard routes do not require a session.
- Creating the first active admin user enables login enforcement for `/admin/*` in addition to any mTLS checks.
- Wiping all users via the Users panel (`WIPE` confirmation) deletes every admin user and returns the system to userless mode (login no longer enforced until a new admin is created).
- Redirect flow when login is enforced:
  - Visiting dashboard routes (`/admin/`, `/admin/hosts/{id}`) without a valid session redirects to `/admin/login`.
  - Visiting `/admin/login` with an active session redirects to `/admin/`.
  - Visiting `/admin/login` while login is not enforced also redirects to `/admin/`.

## Access Model
- `ADMIN_ACCESS_MODE` controls mTLS:
  - `mtls` (default): mTLS is required for `/admin/*` and login sits behind that TLS gate.
  - `none`: mTLS headers are optional; protect `/admin/` using another control (VPN/firewall) and rely on admin login for user-level access.
  - Any value other than `none` is treated as `mtls`.
- WebAuthn/passkey settings:
  - `ADMIN_WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` overrides the relying-party ID; otherwise the app prefers the `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` host before falling back to the trusted request host.
  - `ADMIN_WEBAUTHN_RP_NAME` overrides the relying-party name (default `Codex Orchestrator`).
  - `ADMIN_WEBAUTHN_ORIGIN` overrides the exact origin used for ceremony validation; when unset, the app prefers `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` before deriving origin from the trusted request scheme/host.
- Admin API endpoints:
  - `GET /admin/auth/status` — returns `has_users`, `admin_count` (active admins), `enforced`, `authenticated`, `user`, and role labels.
  - `POST /admin/auth/login/method` — `{username}`; returns the required next step for that active user (`passkey` or `password`).
  - `POST /admin/auth/login` — `{username, password}`; on success issues an HTTP-only session cookie and returns the sanitized user plus `expires_at`. Users with registered passkeys are rejected and must use passkey login.
  - `POST /admin/auth/logout` — clears the current session and expires the cookie.
  - `POST /admin/auth/passkey/login/options` — `{username}`; returns WebAuthn request options for that user’s registered passkeys only.
  - `POST /admin/auth/passkey/login` — completes passkey login and issues the same admin session cookie as password login.
  - `POST /admin/auth/password/request` — `{username}` or `{email}`; always returns the same success shape and sends a one-hour, single-use reset link when an active account matches.
  - `POST /admin/auth/password/reset` — `{token, new_password, confirm_password}`; consumes the token, applies password policy, expires existing sessions, and invalidates outstanding reset tokens.

## Passkeys
- Registration is available to authenticated admins through the dashboard and stores multiple passkeys per user.
- Registration requires WebAuthn user verification (`UV`) and does not force platform-only authenticators.
- Login also requires WebAuthn user verification. The entered username normally determines the `allowCredentials` list; the single-active-user shortcut may omit it. If that user has a registered passkey, passkey becomes the only allowed login method until password recovery revokes the lost passkeys.
- Passkey management endpoints:
  - `POST /admin/auth/passkey/register/options`
  - `POST /admin/auth/passkey/register`
  - `GET /admin/passkeys`
  - `POST /admin/passkeys/{id}/name`
  - `DELETE /admin/passkeys/{id}`
- Recovery for lost passkeys uses the same email password-recovery flow; a successful password reset also removes the user's registered passkeys so password login is available again.

## Sessions
- Cookie name: `ADMIN_SESSION_COOKIE` (default `codex_admin_session`).
- Cookie flags: `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, `Secure` when the request is HTTPS, path `/`.
- Session TTL seconds (`ADMIN_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS`):
  - Default: `28800` (8 hours).
  - Minimum: 300 seconds.
  - Maximum: 604800 seconds (7 days).
- Sessions are stored in `admin_sessions` with `user_id`, `token_hash`, optional `ip`/`user_agent`, `created_at`, `last_seen_at`, and `expires_at`.
- Session tokens are 64-hex random values; only `sha256(token)` is stored in `admin_sessions.token_hash`.
- Session resolution updates `last_seen_at` and deletes expired/invalid sessions.

## Roles & Capabilities
- Role values:
  - `admin` — full access, including user management and wipe.
  - `fleet_operator` — `settings.manage`, `hosts.manage`, `hosts.activate`.
  - `trusted_user` — `hosts.activate`.
  - `user` — no capabilities.
- Capabilities checked in code:
  - `users.manage` — manage admin users (create/update/delete/wipe).
  - `settings.manage` — change admin settings.
  - `hosts.manage` — add/remove hosts and change host properties.
  - `hosts.activate` — open/close insecure host windows.
- Enforcement:
  - When `isEnforced` is false (no active admins): capabilities are not enforced.
  - When enforced and no authenticated user: requests that require a capability fail with `401 Authentication required`.
  - When enforced and the user’s role lacks the capability: requests fail with `403 Forbidden`.
- Some admin routes are session-only (no capability check), including many read endpoints and `POST /admin/toasts`.

## Users & Bootstrap Flows
- Admin users are stored in `admin_users` with: `name`, `username` (unique), `email` (unique), `password_hash`, `access_level`, `active`, `last_login_at`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- User management endpoints (all require admin access and, once users exist, the `users.manage` capability):
  - `GET /admin/users` — list admin users.
  - `POST /admin/users` — create a user from the provided body.
  - `POST /admin/users/{id}` — update user by id.
  - `DELETE /admin/users/{id}` — delete user by id.
  - `POST /admin/users/wipe` — body must include `{"confirm": "WIPE"}`; on success deletes all users and disables login enforcement.
- Bootstrap/user constraints from code:
  - First created user must be `access_level=admin` and `active=true`.
  - Username is normalized to lowercase and must match `^[a-z0-9._-]{3,64}$`.
  - Email is normalized to lowercase and must be a valid email format.
  - Last active admin cannot be demoted, deactivated, or deleted (except via `/admin/users/wipe`).
- The admin UI shows an empty-state notice when no users exist and prompts you to create the first admin.

## Password Policy
- Password minimum length: `ADMIN_PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH` (default `12`), clamped between 8 and 128 characters.
- Password validation is enforced on:
  - New user creation (via admin UI/API).
  - User password updates (`POST /admin/users/{id}` with `password`).

## UI Behavior
- Dedicated login page:
  - `/admin/login` serves a standalone login page.
  - The page starts with username only and a single `Login` button.
  - Submitting a known username with no passkeys reveals the password field.
  - Submitting a known username with passkeys starts the passkey ceremony; password is not offered.
  - Failed login attempts surface a generic error: `Login failed. Check your credentials.`
  - Passkey login uses the same username field and single-button flow.
- Header user display:
  - When authenticated, the top nav shows the current user and a logout button.

## Unknown / Not Found in Code
- Public admin user self-signup flows (e.g., invite links) — Unknown / not found in code.
- TOTP or other non-WebAuthn MFA for admin login — Unknown / not found in code.
