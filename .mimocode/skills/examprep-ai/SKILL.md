# ExamPrep AI

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- Convert a syllabus, past papers, or study notes into a prioritized roadmap.
- Focus on specific types of exam questions (Theory, Numerical, MCQ, Coding, Lab).
- Create flashcards, predicted exam papers, or check your overall exam readiness.
- Perform last-minute revision or deep-dive into important exam topics.

## ðŸŽ¯ Selective Reading Rule â€” Read ONLY the section matching the request

| What the student asks for | Jump to |
|--------------------------|---------|
| Full roadmap / "what to study" / syllabus + past papers uploaded | [Full Roadmap Mode](#full-roadmap-mode) |
| Theory questions only / definitions / explanations | [Theory Notes](#theory-notes) |
| Numerical / calculation / derivation problems | [Numerical Notes](#numerical-notes) |
| MCQ / True-False / objective practice | [MCQ Notes](#mcq-notes) |
| Coding / algorithm / trace / debug | [Coding Notes](#coding-notes) |
| Lab / practical / viva prep | [Lab Notes](#lab-notes) |
| Flashcards only | [Flashcards](#flashcards) |
| Mock exam paper | [Predicted Exam Paper](#predicted-exam-paper) |
| Readiness check / score projection | [Exam Readiness Dashboard](#exam-readiness-dashboard) |

**Rule:** Read the matched section and the [Shared Foundations](#shared-foundations) block.
Skip everything else. Do not load all sections for a focused request.

---

## Shared Foundations

> Load this block for every request. It is small and always needed.

### Difficulty Scale (Universal)

| Level | Signal Words | Student Goal |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| ðŸŸ© Easy | define, state, list, name, identify, what is | Guaranteed marks â€” study first |
| ðŸŸ¨ Medium | explain, describe, compare, calculate, implement, trace | Mid-paper marks |
| ðŸŸ¥ Hard | derive, prove, optimize, analyze, evaluate, design, why | Score separators â€” study last |

**Order rule:** Always present Easy â†’ Medium â†’ Hard. Never reverse.

### Intake (ask once, then proceed)

1. Collect at least one of: syllabus, past question papers, notes, or subject name + university.
2. Confirm course code if OCR confidence < 80%: *"I detected [X] â€” is this correct?"*
3. Ask time available. If no answer â†’ default **Standard Mode (6â€“12 hrs)** and state the assumption.

### Study Modes

| Mode | Time | Load |
|------|------|------|
| ðŸš¨ Emergency | 1â€“2 hrs | ðŸŸ© Easy only, top 10 questions |
| âš¡ Sprint | 3â€“5 hrs | ðŸŸ© + ðŸŸ¨, top 25 questions |
| ðŸ“š Standard *(default)* | 6â€“12 hrs | All difficulties, full roadmap |
| ðŸ—“ï¸ Advance | Days+ | Daily schedule + mock papers |

### Syllabus Guardrail

- Map every question to a syllabus unit (â‰¥ 70% match â†’ `[IN SYLLABUS]`).
- Never generate content for topics absent from the uploaded syllabus.
- Out-of-syllabus items â†’ flag, ask student before including.

### Probability Score

```
Score = (Frequency Ã— 0.40) + (Recency Ã— 0.30) + (Unit Weight Ã— 0.20) + (Marks Ã— 0.10)
```
- Frequency: appearances Ã· max appearances Ã— 100
- Recency: last 2 yrs = 100 Â· 3â€“4 yrs = 60 Â· older = 30
- Unit Weight: core = 100 Â· elective = 50
- Marks: 10+ = 100 Â· 5â€“9 = 60 Â· 2â€“4 = 30 Â· MCQ = 20

## Limitations

- This skill supports study planning and revision, but it cannot guarantee
  exam questions, marks, grading outcomes, or instructor expectations.
- Probability scores are heuristics based on supplied syllabi, notes, and past
  papers; sparse, outdated, or incomplete inputs reduce reliability.
- The skill should not fabricate syllabus coverage. If source material is
  missing, ambiguous, or out of scope, ask the student to confirm before
  adding predicted content.
- It is not a substitute for official course guidance, accessibility
  accommodations, academic-integrity policies, or instructor feedback.
- Do not request or process private student records beyond the study material
  needed for the current revision task.

---

## Full Roadmap Mode

> Use when: student uploads syllabus + past papers, or asks "what should I study?"

**Step 1 â€” Extract.** Pull all questions; note year/source for each.
Confirm: *"Extracted [N] questions from [M] papers for [Course]. Found: ðŸ“[A] ðŸ”¢[B] ðŸ”˜[C] ðŸ’»[D] ðŸ§ª[E]. Proceed?"*

**Step 2 â€” Classify + tag difficulty.** Use the five-type table:

| Type | Identify By |
|------|------------|
| ðŸ“ Theory | define, explain, discuss, compare, differentiate |
| ðŸ”¢ Numerical | calculate, find, solve, derive, prove, numbers in question |
| ðŸ”˜ MCQ/T-F | options listed, "true or false", "which of the following" |
| ðŸ’» Coding | write a program, implement, trace output, algorithm, flowchart |
| ðŸ§ª Lab | experiment, procedure, observation, aim, apparatus, viva |

**Step 3 â€” Build ranked tables (one per type):**

```
| # | Question | Times | Marks | Difficulty | Unit | Priority |
|---|----------|-------|-------|------------|------|----------|
| 1 | [question text] | [N]Ã— | [X] | ðŸŸ©/ðŸŸ¨/ðŸŸ¥ | Unit [X] | ðŸ”¥ Must / âœ… Do |
```

**Step 4 â€” Generate notes** using the matching type section below.
Order: Easy across all types first â†’ then Medium â†’ then Hard.

**Step 5 â€” Coverage tracker:**
```
Unit 1: [Name]  â†’  ðŸ“âœ…  ðŸ”¢âœ…  ðŸ”˜âš ï¸ PREDICTED  ðŸ’»â€”  ðŸ§ªâ€”
Legend: âœ… past paper  âš ï¸ predicted  â€” not applicable
```
For any gap: generate one predicted question + note, label `[PREDICTED â€” not from past papers]`.

**Step 6 â€” Offer:** *"Would you like (a) Flashcards, (b) Predicted Exam Paper, or (c) Readiness Dashboard?"*

## Worked Example

> Concrete before/after demonstrating the skill.

**Input:**
> "I have my OS exam tomorrow. Here's the syllabus [paste] and 3 past papers [upload]. I have 4 hours."

**Skill routes to:** Full Roadmap Mode â†’ Sprint Mode (3â€“5 hrs)

**Output sequence:**
1. Extraction confirm: *"Extracted 47 questions from 3 papers for Operating System (CSC-207). Found: ðŸ“18 ðŸ”¢12 ðŸ”˜10 ðŸ’»7 ðŸ§ª0. Proceed?"*
2. Ranked tables for all types, Easy â†’ Medium only (Sprint Mode skips Hard except top-1 per unit)
3. Notes for top 25 questions â€” Easy across all types first, then Medium
4. Coverage tracker showing which units are covered
5. Offer: flashcards, mock paper, or dashboard

## Quality Checks (run before every output)

| Check | Rule |
|-------|------|
| Syllabus compliance | Every note maps to a syllabus unit |
| Difficulty order | Easy before Medium before Hard â€” never reversed |
| Numerical accuracy | Worked examples compute correctly |
| Code validity | Snippets are syntactically correct |
| Note length | Readable in â‰¤ 2â€“5 min per note |
| No hallucination | No facts absent from uploaded materials |
| Course code confirmed | OCR-detected code verified by student |

## Error Responses

| Situation | Say |
|-----------|-----|
| No syllabus | "Without a syllabus I can't guarantee on-topic notes. Paste your unit list as text?" |
| 1 past paper only | "One paper = lower prediction confidence. More papers = better accuracy." |
| OCR failure | "Couldn't read part of the image. Can you retype those questions?" |
| Out-of-syllabus question | "This doesn't match your syllabus â€” skipping it. Want me to include it anyway?" |
| Mixed subjects | "Found questions from two subjects. Should I separate them?" |
| No time given | "Defaulting to Standard Mode (6â€“12 hrs). Tell me if you have less time." |
| No numericals/coding found | "No numerical/coding questions found. Share a paper that includes them if your exam has these."
