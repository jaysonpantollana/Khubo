# Auth Runner (Sidecar) Behavior

The auth runner is a FastAPI sidecar (`auth-runner` in `docker-compose.yml`) that sanity-checks auth payloads, generates short skill/memory summaries, drafts new skill manifests, and revises skill drafts from a conversation by running `/usr/local/bin/codex` in an isolated temp `$HOME`.

## HTTP surface (runner container)

- `POST /verify` validates Codex credentials. Body: `auth_json` (required object) and `timeout_seconds` (optional float).
- `POST /verify-claude` validates Claude credentials. Native Claude Code OAuth/account-login payloads use the Claude CLI; genuine Anthropic API keys use the Messages API.
- `POST /skills/summarize` generates a short AGENTS-safe skill summary. Body: `auth_json` (required object), `slug` (required string), `manifest` (required string), and optional `timeout_seconds`.
- `POST /memories/summarize` generates a short AGENTS-safe memory summary. Body: `auth_json` (required object), `memory_key` (required string), `content` (required string), and optional `timeout_seconds`.
- `POST /skills/generate` generates a structured skill draft. Body: `auth_json` (required object), `prompt` (required string), optional `slug_hint`, and optional `timeout_seconds`.
- `POST /skills/assist` revises a structured skill draft from a conversation. Body: `auth_json` (required object), `messages` (required array), `skill` (required object), optional `mode`, optional `slug_locked`, and optional `timeout_seconds`.
- `RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET` is mandatory. Every POST surface requires
  `X-Runner-Auth` with an exact match; an unset runner secret fails closed with
  HTTP 500 and a wrong/missing request secret returns 401.
- `GET /health` returns `{"status": "ok"}` and is used by Docker health checks.
- `POST /verify` and `/verify-claude` probe responses include `status`,
  `latency_ms`, `reachable`, `definitive`, the engine version, optional
  `updated_auth`, and optional `reason`. Native probes also report
  `auth_readback` (`unchanged`, `updated`, or `error`) plus
  `auth_readback_error` on a failed post-probe read; direct API-key probes use
  `not_applicable`. A failed result is definitive only
  when the output explicitly identifies credential rejection; provider
  outages, quota/model errors, timeouts, and generic CLI failures remain
  retryable. Anthropic `rate_limit_error` proves the key and returns `ok` with
  `auth_limited:true`.
- `GET /skills/summarize` returns `{"status": "ok"}` so API-side readiness probing can hit the same route used for POST summaries.
- `POST /skills/summarize` success responses include: `status`, `latency_ms`, `reachable`, `codex_version`, optional `summary`, and optional `reason`.
- `GET /memories/summarize` returns `{"status": "ok"}` so API-side readiness probing can hit the same route used for POST summaries.
- `POST /memories/summarize` success responses include: `status`, `latency_ms`, `reachable`, `codex_version`, optional `summary`, and optional `reason`.
- `GET /skills/generate` returns `{"status": "ok"}` so API-side readiness probing can hit the same route used for POST generation.
- `POST /skills/generate` success responses include: `status`, `latency_ms`, `reachable`, `codex_version`, the structured draft fields (`slug`, `display_name`, `description`, `tags`, `what`, `when`, `steps`), and optional `reason`.
- `GET /skills/assist` returns `{"status": "ok"}` so API-side readiness probing can hit the same route used for POST assist calls.
- `POST /skills/assist` success responses include: `status`, `latency_ms`, `reachable`, `codex_version`, `assistant_message`, the structured draft fields (`slug`, `display_name`, `description`, `tags`, `what`, `when`, `steps`), and optional `reason`.
- CLI probe `status` is `ok` only when the command exits `0` and stdout contains
  `banana` (case-insensitive); otherwise it is `fail`. A non-zero CLI exit alone
  is not a credential verdict.
- Error responses: HTTP `400` when no usable token exists and HTTP `500` for
  runner exceptions. Native Codex and Claude probe timeouts are returned as a
  normal non-definitive `status:fail` result while the temporary home still
  exists, so refreshed credential bytes (or an explicit readback error) cannot
  be lost; an unexpected timeout outside that lifecycle may still be HTTP 504.
  API-side runner HTTP errors are always non-definitive infrastructure failures.

## Probe lifecycle (runner/app.py)

1. Optionally persist the incoming auth to `/tmp/last-auth.json` (0600) only when all are true: `RUNNER_DEBUG_DUMP_AUTH=1`, `RUNNER_ALLOW_SECRET_DUMP=1`, and `APP_ENV!=production`.
2. Require at least one usable token from `auths["api.openai.com"]["token"]`, `tokens["access_token"]`, or `tokens["openai_api_key"]`; otherwise return HTTP 400 (`detail: "no usable token in auth_json"`).
3. Create a temp `$HOME` under `RUNNER_HOME_PARENT` (the bundled runner image sets this to `/dev/shm`), point `TMPDIR` / `TMP` / `TEMP` at a writable subdirectory inside that home, write `~/.codex/auth.json`, chmod 0600, and clean up the temp home after the probe.
4. Env for the probe: `CODEX_SYNC_BASE_URL` from runner env when set (otherwise `http://api`), plus `CODEX_SYNC_OPTIONAL=1` and `CODEX_SYNC_BAKED=0`.
5. Run `/usr/local/bin/codex exec -s read-only --skip-git-repo-check "Reply Banana if this works."` with timeout `timeout_seconds` (or `8.0` when unset/falsey).
6. Reload `~/.codex/auth.json` after the probe; when it differs from the input payload, include it in the response as `updated_auth`.
7. Compute `codex_version` from `/usr/local/bin/codex --version`; if that command fails, `codex_version` is `unknown`.

Claude OAuth verification mirrors that isolated-home lifecycle with
`~/.claude/.credentials.json` and the native Claude CLI. Genuine API keys use a
direct Anthropic request; only HTTP 401/`authentication_error` is a definitive
failure, while permission/model/server failures are not.

## Skill summary lifecycle (runner/app.py)

1. Require `slug` and `manifest`; reject blank values with HTTP 400.
2. Reuse the same auth bootstrap path as `/verify`: require a usable token from `auth_json`, create a temp `$HOME`, write `~/.codex/auth.json`, and clean it up after the run.
3. Run `/usr/local/bin/codex exec` with a strict prompt that asks for exactly one short plain-text sentence describing what the skill is used for.
4. Sanitize the result into a single trimmed line (collapse whitespace, strip common bullet/quote wrappers, cap length) before returning it as `summary`.
5. `status` is `ok` only when the command exits `0` and a non-empty sanitized summary is produced; otherwise `status` is `fail` and `reason` includes trimmed stderr/stdout (up to 400 chars).

## Memory summary lifecycle (runner/app.py)

1. Require `memory_key` and `content`; reject blank values with HTTP 400.
2. Reuse the same auth bootstrap path as `/verify` and `/skills/summarize`: require a usable token from `auth_json`, create a temp `$HOME`, write `~/.codex/auth.json`, and clean it up after the run.
3. Run `/usr/local/bin/codex exec` with a strict prompt that asks for exactly one short plain-text sentence describing what the memory contains for AGENTS inventory output.
4. Sanitize the result into a single trimmed line (collapse whitespace, strip common bullet/quote wrappers, cap length) before returning it as `summary`.
5. `status` is `ok` only when the command exits `0` and a non-empty sanitized summary is produced; otherwise `status` is `fail` and `reason` includes trimmed stderr/stdout (up to 400 chars).

## Skill draft lifecycle (runner/app.py)

1. Require a non-empty `prompt`; reject blank values with HTTP 400.
2. Reuse the same auth bootstrap path as `/verify` and `/skills/summarize`: require a usable token from `auth_json`, create a temp `$HOME`, write `~/.codex/auth.json`, and clean it up after the run.
3. Run `/usr/local/bin/codex exec` with a strict prompt that requests exactly one JSON object containing `slug`, `display_name`, `description`, `tags`, `what`, `when`, and `steps`.
4. Parse the returned JSON strictly, sanitize the individual fields, and fail the request when Codex returns malformed or incomplete output.
5. `status` is `ok` only when the command exits `0` and the structured draft parses cleanly; otherwise `status` is `fail` and `reason` includes parse error details plus trimmed stderr/stdout (up to 600 chars).

## Skill assist lifecycle (runner/app.py)

1. Require a non-empty `messages` array and a `skill` object.
2. Reuse the same auth bootstrap path as `/verify` and `/skills/summarize`: require a usable token from `auth_json`, create a temp `$HOME`, write `~/.codex/auth.json`, and clean it up after the run.
3. Run `/usr/local/bin/codex exec` with a strict prompt that includes the current structured draft, the conversation history, and whether the slug is locked.
4. Parse the returned JSON strictly. Require `assistant_message`, `slug`, `display_name`, `description`, `tags`, `what`, `when`, and `steps`, then sanitize the individual fields.
5. `status` is `ok` only when the command exits `0` and the structured assist payload parses cleanly; otherwise `status` is `fail` and `reason` includes parse error details plus trimmed stderr/stdout (up to 600 chars).

## How the API uses it (`api/src/services/host-auth.ts` + `api/src/services/runner-client.ts`)

- Runner is enabled only when `AUTH_RUNNER_URL` is a non-empty string; otherwise the runner client is not created.
- API boot checks probe the runner's derived `/health` endpoint once for per-engine telemetry. Credential verification itself sends one `POST` directly to `/verify` or `/verify-claude`; transport/parse/HTTP failures are non-definitive and report `reachable=false` only for an actual transport/provider-unreachable signal.
- Runner request payload includes only `auth_json` and `timeout_seconds`. When `AUTH_RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET` is set, the client also sends `X-Runner-Auth`. The API HTTP transport allows an additional bounded six-second response/readback grace beyond the native probe deadline; this lets a timed-out CLI return any rotated credential bytes safely instead of losing them at the transport boundary.
- OpenAI-compatible `/exec` request payload includes `auth_json`, `prompt`, optional `images[]`, optional `model`, and `timeout_seconds`; when `model` is present the runner invokes `codex --model <id> exec ...`, and each image is materialized to a temp file then passed through as `codex --image <file>`.
- Skill summary request payload includes `auth_json`, `slug`, `manifest`, and `timeout_seconds`. The API only asks for summaries when a skill is created or its manifest changes and no explicit description was supplied.
- Memory summary request payload includes `auth_json`, `memory_key`, `content`, and `timeout_seconds`. The API asks for summaries after memory create/update writes and may backfill them on unchanged writes when an older row still lacks `summary`.
- Skill draft request payload includes `auth_json`, `prompt`, optional `slug_hint`, and `timeout_seconds`. The API uses it only for the admin-only `POST /admin/skills/generate` draft flow; generated drafts are not persisted until the admin later calls `POST /admin/skills/store`.
- Skill assist request payload includes `auth_json`, `messages`, `skill`, optional `mode`, optional `slug_locked`, and `timeout_seconds`. The API uses it only for the admin-only `POST /admin/skills/assist` conversational draft flow; generated drafts are not persisted until the admin later calls `POST /admin/skills/store`.
- `/auth` `store` with `skipRunner=false`:
  - If the candidate payload would update canonical auth and the runner is configured, a positive live verdict is mandatory.
  - With no configured runner, a new/newer lineage may be stored `pending`; it cannot repair a selected `failed` lineage.
  - If the runner is unreachable or returns a non-definitive failure without changing credentials, the update returns HTTP 503 and canonical state is unchanged.
  - If a timeout/non-definitive probe changed the credential file, usable replacement bytes are stored as a new `pending` lineage before the request fails with the wrapper-recognized unsafe-refresh code `runner_updated_auth_invalid`. If a probe changed credentials before a definitive rejection, the replacement is retained as the newest `failed` lineage and the same unsafe-refresh 503 is returned, so neither the rejected replacement nor the possibly consumed pre-probe credential can be served. Missing, unreadable, malformed, older, or wrong-engine replacement bytes fail closed and mark an already-selected old lineage unsafe where applicable.
  - A definitive provider-auth rejection with unchanged credentials returns HTTP 422. Generic provider/CLI failures never become credential verdicts.
  - If runner `updated_auth` omits `last_refresh`, it inherits the upload generation for validation. A supplied stamp must be RFC3339 and same/newer, and the payload must retain usable engine credentials. When its digest changes canonical auth without advancing that stamp, persistence assigns a bounded timestamp at least 1 ms after the selected lineage; it fails closed if no later millisecond fits below `now+300s`.
  - A present `updated_auth` must be structurally usable and same/newer than the submitted generation. Older or malformed refreshed credentials fail the store closed; the pre-refresh candidate is never stamped verified after the runner reports a changed credential.
- `POST /seed/auth/{token}`, `POST /admin/auth/upload`, and `/sync/bootstrap` inline `auth_candidate` call the same runner-validated store path as host `/auth`, so runner `updated_auth` can become canonical there too.
- **Background launch-gate verification (both engines).** The API starts an
  auth-verification worker when `AUTH_RUNNER_URL` is configured. It runs on boot
  and then every `AUTH_RUNNER_VERIFY_WORKER_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default `300`),
  checking the latest Claude and Codex canonical payloads when their stored
  verdict is older than `AUTH_RUNNER_VERIFY_TTL_SECONDS` (default `900`). `/auth
  retrieve` and the `/sync/bootstrap` candidate-match path do not call the
  runner inline; they surface the latest stored `verification_state`
  (`verified` | `failed` | `unknown`) plus optional `verification_reason`:
  - `verified` — token chain proved live by the worker or a strict store path;
    served normally.
  - `failed` — runner reached the provider and the credentials do not work; the
    known-bad blob is withheld and the wrapper refuses launch with a re-login
    prompt instead of a raw 401 (Claude) / `refresh token already used` (Codex).
    A probe that rotates credentials before definitively rejecting them retains
    the replacement as the newest failed lineage. A successful probe that
    returned unusable replacement bytes, or whose refreshed writeback failed,
    instead marks the old lineage failed because it may already have been
    consumed.
  - `unknown` — runner not configured or unreachable; the response preserves the
    legacy digest-derived status and the wrapper keeps its offline/cached
    behaviour (a runner outage never downgrades a payload to `failed`).
  All canonical-changing work is queued per engine inside the API process.
  Worker/store probes for the same canonical payload are additionally
  single-flighted (keyed by engine + payload id) so a fleet of checks cannot
  race the refresh-token rotation into spurious `failed` verdicts. A final
  canonical compare-and-swap runs after each probe. When the runner
  refreshes the token during a worker probe, the refreshed blob is persisted as a
  fresh canonical (rotation-safe) and picked up by the next retrieve. After a
  stale live probe reaches the runner, the worker also updates the engine-scoped
  runner telemetry (`runner_last_ok[_claude]` or `runner_last_fail[_claude]`),
  so the admin runner card reflects the background auth-readiness check rather
  than only boot-time or manual checks.
- `store` responses always include `runner_applied` and `verification_state`.
- The auth-verification worker is timer-driven, not request-driven; wrapper
  startup does not wait for stale canonical auth to be re-probed.
- Recovery behavior when `runner_state=fail`: retries are triggered on boot-id change or after ~15 minutes since `runner_last_fail` (`fail_backoff` path). Recovery failures are logged and do not block serving auth.
- Manual trigger `POST /admin/runner/run` forces one Codex runner pass
  (`trigger=manual`) and returns whether canonical digest changed (`applied`).
  `POST /admin/runner/run-claude` verifies the latest Claude canonical payload
  through `/verify-claude`; Claude Code OAuth/account-login payloads are checked
  with a native Claude CLI probe instead of treating the OAuth access token as a
  public Anthropic API key.
- Runner telemetry stored in `versions`: `runner_state`, `runner_last_ok`, `runner_last_fail`, `runner_last_check` (set only when the runner request was reachable or a background auth probe produced a final provider verdict), Claude-suffixed equivalents, `runner_boot_id`, and `daily_preflight`.

## Network and IP notes

- Runner-originated requests can bypass host-IP rebinding when `AUTH_RUNNER_IP_BYPASS` is truthy (`1`, `true`, `yes`, `on`) and caller IP matches a CIDR in `AUTH_RUNNER_BYPASS_SUBNETS`; those requests are logged as `auth.runner_ip_bypass`.
- Code defaults: `AUTH_RUNNER_IP_BYPASS=0` and `AUTH_RUNNER_BYPASS_SUBNETS=''`. Compose/.env defaults keep bypass disabled unless explicitly enabled.
- Disabling runner (`AUTH_RUNNER_URL` empty/unset) reports `runner_enabled=false`
  in version snapshots. New/newer host, admin, seed, and bootstrap candidates may
  enter `pending`; replacing a selected `failed` canonical still requires live
  verification and returns 503 until the runner is restored.

## Configuration quick reference

- `AUTH_RUNNER_URL` (API): runner endpoint URL used for readiness GET + verification POST. Code default: empty (disabled). Compose default: `http://auth-runner:8080/verify`.
- `AUTH_RUNNER_SKILL_SUMMARY_URL` (API): optional explicit runner skill-summary endpoint. When unset, API derives it from `AUTH_RUNNER_URL` by replacing `/verify` with `/skills/summarize`.
- `AUTH_RUNNER_MEMORY_SUMMARY_URL` (API): optional explicit runner memory-summary endpoint. When unset, API derives it from `AUTH_RUNNER_URL` by replacing `/verify` with `/memories/summarize`.
- `AUTH_RUNNER_SKILL_GENERATE_URL` (API): optional explicit runner skill-generation endpoint. When unset, API derives it from `AUTH_RUNNER_URL` by replacing `/verify` with `/skills/generate`.
- Skill assist endpoint is derived from `AUTH_RUNNER_URL` by replacing `/verify` with `/skills/assist`.
- `AUTH_RUNNER_TIMEOUT` (API): native provider/CLI probe timeout passed to the verifier payload. The API verifier HTTP request adds a fixed six-second readback/response grace. Default probe timeout: `8` seconds.
- `AUTH_RUNNER_CODEX_BASE_URL` (API): legacy compatibility setting retained in config/setup flows; runner verification no longer sends a `base_url` field.
- `AUTH_RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET` (API): when non-empty, API includes `X-Runner-Auth` in runner requests.
- `AUTH_RUNNER_PREFLIGHT_SECONDS` (API): legacy preflight interval retained for old deployments. Default: `28800` (8h).
- `AUTH_RUNNER_VERIFY_TTL_SECONDS` (API): background verification freshness. Default: `900` (15m). Within the window a prior `verified` or `failed` verdict is trusted by worker probes.
- `AUTH_RUNNER_VERIFY_WORKER_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (API): background verifier interval. Default: `300` (5m), minimum effective interval 30s.
- `AUTH_RUNNER_IP_BYPASS` / `AUTH_RUNNER_BYPASS_SUBNETS` (API): controls runner CIDR IP-bypass behavior in host authentication.
- `CODEX_SYNC_BASE_URL` (runner container): used by runner probe process; fallback in runner code is `http://api`.
- `RUNNER_HOME_PARENT` (runner container): parent directory for isolated temp homes used by runner Codex calls. The bundled image sets this to `/dev/shm`.
- `RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET` (runner container): validates incoming `X-Runner-Auth` for `/verify`, `/skills/summarize`, `/memories/summarize`, `/skills/generate`, and `/skills/assist`.
- `RUNNER_DEBUG_DUMP_AUTH` + `RUNNER_ALLOW_SECRET_DUMP` (runner container): both must be `1` to allow `/tmp/last-auth.json` writes; still disabled when `APP_ENV=production`.
