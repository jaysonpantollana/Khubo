Every host gets its credentials by asking the orchestrator; the orchestrator is the single writer of canonical auth payloads. The pipeline is built around three requirements: **encrypt at rest**, **authenticate the caller**, and **refuse to hand out anything a compromised host should not have**.

## The public endpoints

- `POST /auth` — the main host-facing auth endpoint. Accepts a `command` field: `retrieve` (default) or `store`. Both paths authenticate the caller via API key extracted from HTTP **headers**.
- `POST /sync/status` / `POST /sync/bootstrap` — sync endpoints the wrappers hit on every run. Both inline an auth check (unless `include_auth=false`) and embed the result in the response — see *Sync routes* below for how the two differ.
- `DELETE /auth` — self-uninstall. `?engine=codex|claude` transactionally removes only that engine's host auth state, overrides, and pending installer tokens when another engine remains; removing the final engine or using the legacy no-engine route deletes the host. Both paths audit and publish an event.

API keys are read from HTTP **headers** in all cases via `extractApiKey(req.headers)` in `host-auth.ts`. There is no body-based API key flavor.

## `POST /auth` — the two command paths

### Retrieve (`command=retrieve`, default)

`handleRetrieve` is called. Steps in order:

1. **Authenticate** — API key extracted from headers, hashed, matched against `hosts.api_key_hash` (fallback to plaintext `hosts.api_key` for legacy rows).
2. **Check the insecure window** — `maybeEnforceInsecure` tests whether the host may receive auth. If outside both window and grace, and no `insecure_domain_allows` match exists, an `insecure_auth_requests` row is inserted and the caller sees a 423.
3. **Resolve the canonical payload** — follows the engine's explicit
   `auth_canonical_heads` pointer and decrypts/validates that row. Timestamp
   ordering remains only as a legacy fallback before the generation-ledger
   backfill. An older verified history row is never resurrected behind a newer
   lineage. Decryption happens in `validateCanonicalPayload` /
   `decodePayloadBody` via `decryptOrNull`.
4. **Compare digests** — the host-submitted `digest`/`auth_digest`/`auth_sha` is compared against the canonical digest. Returns one of:
   - `status: 'valid'` — digests match, host is current.
   - `status: 'outdated'` — host is behind; response includes the decrypted auth blob unless the selected canonical is `failed`.
   - `status: 'upload_required'` — host has a newer timestamp; tells the host to store.
   - `status: 'missing'` — no canonical payload exists yet.
5. **No live runner call** — retrieve never blocks on a live runner probe. It consults the latest stored verdict from the background auth-verification worker (see below) via `servedVerificationSnapshot`; if that verdict is `failed`, retrieve returns `status: 'outdated'` *without* the `auth` blob rather than serving known-bad credentials.

The retrieve response includes `versions`, `canonical_digest`, `canonical_last_refresh`, `host`, `api_calls`, `engine`, `quota_hard_fail`, `quota_limit_percent`, and `verification_state` (`verified`/`failed`/`unknown`, plus `verification_reason` when `failed`). A distributable `status: 'outdated'` carries `auth`; a failed canonical deliberately does not. Codex retrieves also carry a `chatgpt` usage snapshot. Skills manifests and AGENTS.md hashes are part of `/sync/bootstrap`, not `/auth`.

### Store (`command=store`)

`handleStore` is called. Steps in order:

1. **Authenticate** — same header-based key check as retrieve.
2. **Admit the candidate** — insecure `store` bypasses the retrieve-window gate even when window and grace are fully closed. API-key, engine, IP, reverse-DNS, installation, token-quality, and runner checks still apply, and the store does not open or extend the window.
3. **Accept, inspect, and canonicalize the auth blob** — the `auth` body field
   is normalized while preserving native OAuth fields. Access/refresh identity
   is recorded only as keyed HMAC fingerprints. Exact matches to any
   superseded generation are rejected before runner work; host OAuth uploads
   with comparable native issue/expiry metadata must be strictly newer than
   current canonical auth.
4. **Serialize and runner-verify** — one process-wide queue per engine prevents
   concurrent store/worker probes from racing one refresh-token lineage. The
   runner calls `/verify` (Codex) or `/verify-claude` with the shared secret.
   Recognized provider authentication rejection with unchanged credentials
   returns a definitive 422. If the probe rotated credentials first, the
   replacement is retained as failed and the store returns the unsafe-refresh
   503 instead.
   Transport/timeouts, provider 5xx, quota/model failures, unexpected CLI
   output, and other unclassified failures are non-definitive 503 outcomes and
   do not poison the current canonical row.
5. **CAS and persist** — after the runner returns, the service resolves canonical
   auth again. A newer/equal winner is returned instead of overwritten. A
   usable `updated_auth` replaces the upload. Every accepted digest change gets
   a canonical `last_refresh` at least 1 ms after the selected lineage when the
   submitted/native stamp ties it, so delayed concurrent wrapper responses can
   still converge on the rotated token. A replacement observed before a
   definitive rejection is persisted as the newest failed lineage; a present
   but unusable rotated payload fails closed rather than stamping the
   pre-rotation token verified.
   The encrypted payload/entries, supersession metadata, explicit canonical
   head, and host digest/state upsert commit in one transaction. Results are
   `updated`, `valid`, or `outdated`, carrying the authoritative payload,
   digest, generation, and candidate classification.

Superseded generations are replay evidence for 180 days. The daily retention
worker deletes only rows whose supersession deadline passed and which are not
an engine head; current canonical credentials do not expire merely because of
their age.

## Authentication in host-auth.ts

`hostAuth.authenticate(req)` extracts the API key from HTTP headers. It hashes the key and looks up `hosts.api_key_hash`; falls back to plaintext `hosts.api_key` for legacy rows.

**IP binding** uses separate `ip4` and `ip6` columns per address family — not a single `first_seen_ip` column. Enforcement:

- First successful auth from a given address family binds that column.
- Subsequent requests must match the bound address unless `allowRoamingIps=1` or the insecure window is active.
- Addresses in `AUTH_RUNNER_BYPASS_SUBNETS` bypass IP binding entirely (for runner/admin calls).

Toggle per-host roaming at `POST /admin/hosts/{id}/roaming`. Toggle reverse-DNS enforcement at `POST /admin/hosts/{id}/reverse-dns` or the fleet-wide default at `POST /admin/reverse-dns`.

## Insecure windows

An insecure host is one where the machine is not fully trusted to hold credentials at rest. Constants are defined in `insecure-window.ts`:

- `DEFAULT_WINDOW = 10` minutes
- `MAX_WINDOW = 480` minutes
- `PROVISIONING_WINDOW_MINUTES = 30`
- `APPROVAL_DENY_COOLDOWN_SECONDS = 60`

The window slides on each non-store hit while active. `store` candidates bypass this window entirely, including after `graceUntil`, without extending it. For retrieve-style calls, a matching `insecure_domain_allows` row **auto-opens a new window**; otherwise an `insecure_auth_requests` row is inserted (status=pending) and the caller sees a 423. A recent `denied` row within `APPROVAL_DENY_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` causes a 403 instead.

## Sync routes

Both `/sync/status` and `/sync/bootstrap`:

1. Call `hostAuth.authenticate`.
2. Call `maybeEnforceInsecure`.
3. Call `syncService.collect`.
4. Inline an auth check (unless `include_auth=false`) and embed the result in `out.auth`.

The auth step differs between the two routes. `/sync/status` always inlines a plain `handleRetrieve`. `/sync/bootstrap` additionally accepts `auth_candidate`: a matching digest uses the stored verdict; a genuinely newer usable candidate enters the runner-validated store path; an older candidate yields to a newer verified canonical. A selected `pending`/`failed` lineage is never bypassed by older history. Deterministically malformed, unusable, or provider-rejected candidates may fall back to an older verified canonical only with `candidate_rejected_definitive:true`, `status:outdated`, and `verification_state:verified`. Transient runner/provider/CLI/HTTP failures omit that authority and preserve the locally newer generation for retry.

`/sync/bootstrap` additionally fetches agents, config, `claude_artifacts`, `claude_settings`, `claude_skills` (Claude engine only), and session counts. `status: ok` vs `update` is determined by whether `out.reasons` is empty.

The `host_auth_digests` table is written on store/retrieve, but the sync routes do not short-circuit via a digest lookup — they always run the auth step described above.

## Encryption

Payloads are encrypted with libsodium's `crypto_secretbox` via `api/src/security/secret-box.ts`. The `Keyring` (`api/src/security/keyring.ts`) reads:

- `ENCRYPTION_KEYS` (or legacy `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEYS`) as `kid:base64,...` pairs.
- `ENCRYPTION_ACTIVE_KEY` (or `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) as the single active key.
- `ENCRYPTION_ACTIVE_KID` (or `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_ACTIVE_KID`) to identify the active key.

The active KID encrypts all new writes. Decryption selects the key by stored KID. Adding a new key and rotating the active KID is the supported rotation path.

Lose all keys and the encrypted rows are unreadable. Back up the keyring.

## The runner contract

`runner-client.ts` exposes the routes the API uses:

- `POST /verify` — Codex engine verification. Takes the auth blob, returns `ok` + optionally `updated_auth`.
- `POST /verify-claude` — Claude engine verification. Same contract.
- `/skills/generate`, `/skills/assist`, `/projects/assist` — feature endpoints derived from the base URL.

There is no `/exec` endpoint in this client. All runner calls use the
`x-runner-auth` header with `AUTH_RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET` sent as-is. Responses
carry both `reachable` and `definitive`: provider contact or an HTTP-200 runner
response alone does not make a failure definitive. Only a recognized
authentication rejection can normally move canonical auth to `failed`. A
replacement produced before that rejection is retained as the newest failed
lineage. A successful runner rotation that returns unusable replacement bytes,
or whose refreshed payload cannot be persisted, instead fails the pre-rotation
lineage closed because it may already have been consumed.

## Background auth verification

Host startup never waits on a live runner probe. Instead `api/src/ops/auth-verification-worker.ts` starts an in-process worker (only when `AUTH_RUNNER_URL` is configured) that keeps the latest Codex and Claude canonical payloads verified in the background:

- The first tick fires ~1 second after boot; subsequent ticks run every `AUTH_RUNNER_VERIFY_WORKER_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default 300s, floor 30s).
- Each tick calls `canonical-auth-store.ts`'s `ensureServedVerification` for both engines, TTL-bounded by `AUTH_RUNNER_VERIFY_TTL_SECONDS` (default 900s): a payload verified within the TTL is left alone; otherwise the worker probes the runner live.
- A `verified` verdict stamps `auth_payloads.verification_state` / `verification_checked_at`. A `failed` verdict (the runner reached the provider and the credentials don't work) also stamps `verification_reason` — this is what makes `/auth retrieve` refuse to serve that payload (`status: 'outdated'`, no `auth` blob).
- If the runner returns a refreshed `updated_auth` with a newer digest, the worker persists it as a new canonical payload via the same `storeCandidate` path a `store` upload uses.
- Canonical-changing store and worker work is serialized per engine inside the API process, then compare-and-swapped after the runner call. Concurrent probes for the same canonical row are additionally collapsed by engine/payload id, so a fleet of hosts hitting an expired token at the same moment does not spawn a refresh-token race.
- A transport failure (`reachable: false`) leaves the stored state untouched and is reported as `unknown`, not `failed` — an infrastructure blip does not lock hosts out.

`/auth retrieve` and `/sync/bootstrap`'s warm-launch path only ever read this stored verdict via `servedVerificationSnapshot` (synchronous, no I/O) — they never call `ensureServedVerification` themselves. `store` (both a direct upload and this worker's refresh path) is the only caller that performs a live runner call, via `storeCandidate`.

## Credentials file on the host

For cdx, the effective `CODEX_HOME/auth.json` contains the stabilized generation.
Its bounded sidecar records both verified canonical digests and the current
wrapper-stabilized local digest/stamp. This local logical clock makes a native Y
strictly newer than accepted X even after host clock rollback or an old mtime;
an immediate/offline next cdx sees the exact Y as fresh. A successful real
`cdx login` always proves its resulting auth through the API/runner, and
`auth-upload` retries one in-flight native replacement before failing visibly.
For both wrappers, only store `valid`/`updated` accepts the exact candidate. A
canonical-win `outdated` response can still carry guarded download bytes, but
never acknowledges the upload, clears logout intent, or prints upload success.
For clx, `~/.claude/.credentials.json` is the sole read authority; the legacy
`~/.clx/auth/credentials.json` is an optional write-only mirror. clx stores its
versioned digest-bound `last_refresh` in `~/.clx/auth/generation.json`, keeping wrapper
metadata out of Claude's native file. Both wrappers use short auth-file locks,
fsynced atomic renames, generation compare-and-swap after network calls, and
nonce-bearing logout-marker byte CAS. Separate auth-path-keyed active-child
leases cover wrapper-launched native processes; blocked canonical writes fail
when no usable local credential remains. Shared sessions update their durable
purge request from live API security metadata, and only the last exiting process
purges insecure credentials. Active children defer cleanup; logout intent
survives. Raw `codex`/`claude` processes launched outside the wrappers cannot
participate in these leases.

## Killing the pipeline in an emergency

- **Fleet kill-switch**: `assertApiNotDisabled` checks a single `api_disabled` flag in the `versions` table. Flipping it refuses auth for all engines. The `/auth` endpoint itself is not disabled, but hosts see refusal responses.
- **Delete a host**: `DELETE /admin/hosts/{id}`. The host's API key is invalidated; future `/auth` calls fail authentication.
- **Host self-uninstall**: `DELETE /auth?engine=codex|claude` removes that engine
  while preserving the other engine on a dual-engine host. The legacy route
  without `engine` deletes the host. Both are logged and broadcast.
- **Purge insecure creds immediately**: `POST /admin/hosts/{id}/insecure/disable` — closes the window, forcing the host back into the approval queue.
