# Dashboard

The dashboard combines host health, ChatGPT quota windows, runner state, and version status.

## Data sources

- **Overview** — `GET /admin/overview` (registered in `api/src/routes/admin/overview/index.ts`, alongside `/admin/logs`, `/admin/chatgpt/usage*`, `/admin/runner/*`, and `/admin/toasts` — other admin route groups such as hosts, settings, config, auth, and users are registered from sibling files under `api/src/routes/admin/`) returns host totals, versions, quota settings, and the cached ChatGPT summary.
- **ChatGPT quota** — `ChatGptUsageService` (`api/src/services/chatgpt-usage.ts`) reads canonical Codex auth and stores quota snapshots. The dashboard card surfaces `primary_window` and `secondary_window` from the unified summary.
- **Graph stats** — `dashboard_graph_quota_snapshots` is a compact quota-history table, kept separate from the verbose raw `logs` table. `ChatGptUsageService` writes a row to it on every quota fetch (`recordGraphSnapshot()`). `DashboardStatsService` (`api/src/services/dashboard-stats.ts`) exposes a `quotaSnapshots()` reader over the same table, but nothing in the current API or frontend calls it — the "View history" chart in the ChatGPT usage card reads `chatgpt_usage_snapshots` directly via `ChatGptUsageService.history()` instead.

## Overview endpoint

`GET /admin/overview` returns: host count (`totals.hosts`), `last_refresh`, `avg_refresh_age_days`, version summaries for both codex and claude engines, a `chatgpt_usage` snapshot and `chatgpt_usage_summary`, and a full set of settings flags (quota thresholds, scaling status, theme, retention policy, client version lock, and others).

## Stat cards

The dashboard renders three stat cards sourced from a single `overviewQuery()` call against `GET /admin/overview`:

| Card | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hosts | `totals.hosts` | Always shows total host count. An active-only subset is not available from this endpoint without a separate round-trip; the card falls back to the total. |
| Codex latest | `versions.cdx_version_available` | Latest upstream Codex CLI version (GitHub releases) — **not** the installed version. |
| Claude latest | `versions.claude_version_available` | Latest upstream Claude Code CLI version (npm) — **not** the installed version. |

The Hosts card displays a relative-time hint derived from `last_refresh` (e.g. "no refreshes yet", "<1h since last refresh"). The two "latest" cards show a "checked Xm/h/d ago" hint derived from `versions.cdx_version_checked_at` / `versions.claude_version_checked_at` (both are 1-hour-cached upstream lookups refreshed as a side effect of loading `/admin/overview`). The currently *installed* client version (`versions.client_version` / `cdx_version`, `versions.claude_version`) is not shown on a stat card at all — it only surfaces in the "Update available" alert banner and its `UpgradeModal` (see Alerts, below).

## Alerts

`DashboardAlerts` renders between the stat cards and the usage cards. Up to three banners are shown conditionally:

- **Insecure approvals** (warning) — `insecureApprovalsPendingQuery()` counts hosts awaiting insecure-window approval. When the count is non-zero a warning banner lists the count and links to `/hosts?insecure=1` ("Review").
- **Could not check insecure approvals** (destructive) — shown instead of the warning banner when that query itself errors, with a "Retry" button.
- **Update available** (info) — on mount, `versionsCheckMutation()` makes a one-shot network call to check the latest release and compares `available_client` against the installed `client_version` / `cdx_version`. When a newer version is detected an info banner appears with a "View" button that opens the `UpgradeModal` showing current and available versions.

## ChatGPT usage card

`ChatGptUsageCard` calls `chatgptUsageQuery()` (`GET /admin/chatgpt/usage`) and `chatgptHistoryQuery(60)` (`GET /admin/chatgpt/usage/history?days=60&interval=day`) for the history series. It renders:

- `primary_window.used_percent` and `secondary_window.used_percent` as `UsageMeter` progress bars labeled "5-hour window" and "Weekly window".
- An inline `Sparkline` of recent usage, drawn from whichever history series has data (weekly preferred over 5-hour when both exist).
- "cached" appended to the card description (next to the plan type) when the response was served from cache — this is plain text, not a separate badge component.
- A "Rate limit reached" warning alert when `rate_limit_reached` is true, showing the next-eligible time when known.
- A "View history" button that opens a modal containing a full `TrendChart`.
- An explicit refresh button that posts to `POST /admin/chatgpt/usage/refresh`.

There are no separate "normal lane" vs "Spark lane" meters in the rendered card — only `primary_window` and `secondary_window` from the unified summary are displayed.

## Runner

The Runner state card polls `GET /admin/runner` every 15 seconds — there are no WebSocket events for runner state changes today, so polling is the only refresh trigger. It reads `runner.engines.codex` and `runner.engines.claude` and renders one row per engine showing only the current per-engine status badge (`idle` / `OK` / `fail` / `not configured`; `running` is a defined-but-unused state because `POST /admin/runner/run(-claude)` are synchronous calls that only resolve once the sidecar verification finishes) and a "Run verification" button. A separate overall badge in the card header (`idle` / `ready` / `fail` / `not configured`) summarizes `runner.configured` / `runner.ready`. The Codex row triggers `POST /admin/runner/run`; the Claude row triggers `POST /admin/runner/run-claude`. Triggering one engine also disables the other engine's button while that mutation is in flight. After a trigger the query is explicitly invalidated to reflect the updated state.

## Refresh

There is no keyboard shortcut for refreshing the dashboard. ChatGPT quota refreshes are explicit (the refresh button posts to `/admin/chatgpt/usage/refresh`) because they hit the upstream usage page; most other reads are local-table lookups that re-run on the normal query lifecycle.

## Host management

**New Host** and **Quick VM** are not on the dashboard. Both controls live on the Hosts page (`/hosts`). Quick VM creates an insecure temporary `tmp-*` host via `POST /admin/hosts/quick-register`.
