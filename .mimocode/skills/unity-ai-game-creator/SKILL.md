# Unity AI Game Creator

## Overview

This skill transforms a raw game concept into a fully structured Unity development plan with AI-generated assets, scenes, music, scripts, and deployment-ready builds. It guides the agent through a 5-phase pipeline â€” from extracting core game dimensions to producing ready-to-use AI prompts for every asset category â€” using the latest Unity 6+ features and AI tooling ecosystem. Unlike generic Unity reference skills, this skill is workflow-driven: the user provides an idea, and the agent delivers a complete, actionable game development roadmap.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when a user describes a game idea and wants a complete development plan
- Use when generating AI prompts for 3D models, textures, music, sound effects, or UI assets
- Use when setting up a new Unity project from scratch with modern architecture
- Use when creating Scene Blueprints from a concept description
- Use when building a Game Design Document (GDD) from a rough idea
- Use when leveraging Unity AI Assistant, MCP server, or external AI tools in a game workflow
- Use when planning monetization, performance budgets, or app store deployment

## How It Works

### Master Pipeline

Execute these phases in order. Each phase produces concrete deliverables before advancing.

```
PHASE 1: IDEATION â”€â”€â–¶ PHASE 2: BLUEPRINT â”€â”€â–¶ PHASE 3: GENERATION â”€â”€â–¶ PHASE 4: ASSEMBLY â”€â”€â–¶ PHASE 5: DEPLOYMENT
  Game Brief            GDD + Scenes           AI Prompts + Assets     Project Setup          Build + Store
  Genre Analysis        Architecture           Scripts + Audio         Core Systems           QA + Submit
  Scope Assessment      Scene Blueprints       Voice + UI              Polish + Juice         Analytics
```

### Phase 1: Ideation & Deep Analysis

Extract and clarify these dimensions from the user's game idea. Ask only for what is ambiguous â€” infer the rest from context.

| Dimension | What to Extract | If Unclear |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **Genre** | Primary + secondary genre blend | Suggest 3 genre combinations |
| **Platform** | Mobile, PC, Console, WebGL, VR/AR | Recommend based on scope |
| **Perspective** | 2D, 2.5D, 3D, Top-down, Side-scroll, FPS, TPS | Infer from genre |
| **Art Style** | Realistic, Stylized, Pixel, Low-poly, Anime, Painterly | Suggest 3 options |
| **Core Loop** | The 30-second repeating gameplay action | Identify from description |
| **Target Audience** | Age range, gamer profile, platform habits | Recommend based on genre |
| **Session Length** | Average play session duration | Infer from platform + genre |
| **Monetization** | Free-to-play, Premium, Hybrid | Recommend based on platform |
| **Scope** | Solo dev, small team, studio | Ask if not obvious |
| **Timeline** | MVP in weeks, full release target | Suggest realistic milestones |

**Also provide:**
1. **Top 3 Reference Games** â€” What they do well, what the user can learn
2. **Market Gap** â€” What opportunity exists that competitors miss
3. **Core Differentiator** â€” The one unique thing about this game
4. **Risk Assessment** â€” Technical and market risks with mitigations

**Scope Calibration:**

| Scope | Timeline | Team Size | Feature Budget |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Prototype | 1â€“2 weeks | Solo | Core loop only |
| Vertical Slice | 4â€“6 weeks | Soloâ€“2 | 1 complete level + polish |
| MVP | 8â€“12 weeks | 2â€“4 | 3â€“5 levels + save + UI |
| Full Release | 16â€“24+ weeks | 3â€“8 | Complete content + multiplayer |

### Phase 2: Blueprint & Design

#### Game Design Document (GDD)

Generate a structured GDD covering:

1. **Executive Summary** â€” Elevator pitch, genre, USPs
2. **Gameplay** â€” Core loop diagram, progression, abilities, win/loss, difficulty curve
3. **World & Narrative** â€” Setting, characters, level structure
4. **Art Direction** â€” Visual style, color palette (hex codes), reference descriptions, UI/UX style
5. **Audio Direction** â€” Music style per scene, SFX categories, voice needs
6. **Technical Spec** â€” Unity version, render pipeline, performance budgets, SDKs
7. **Monetization Strategy** â€” Revenue model, IAP design, ad placement
8. **Development Roadmap** â€” Phases, milestones, feature priority matrix, risk register

#### Scene Blueprints

For each scene, produce a hierarchy covering:

- **Environment** â€” Ground/terrain, skybox, lighting setup, props with positions
- **Interactive Objects** â€” Behavior on interaction
- **Characters / NPCs** â€” AI behavior, patrol paths, dialogue triggers
- **UI Overlay** â€” HUD elements, contextual prompts
- **Audio Layers** â€” Background music (mood, tempo, loop point), ambient SFX, trigger SFX
- **Camera Setup** â€” Type (Cinemachine/Fixed/Follow), behavior configuration
- **Systems Active** â€” Save checkpoints, spawners, particle effects

#### Architecture Blueprint

Provide recommended project folder structure:

```
Assets/_Project/
â”œâ”€â”€ Scripts/ (Core, Gameplay, UI, Data, Audio, Utilities)
â”œâ”€â”€ Prefabs/ (Characters, Environment, UI, VFX)
â”œâ”€â”€ Scenes/
â”œâ”€â”€ Art/ (Models, Textures, Materials, Animations, UI_Assets)
â”œâ”€â”€ Audio/ (Music, SFX, Ambience)
â”œâ”€â”€ ScriptableObjects/
â””â”€â”€ Resources/
```

### Phase 3: AI-Powered Asset Generation

For every asset category, provide ready-to-use prompts for the best current AI tools.

#### 3D Model Prompts

Recommend tools dynamically (Meshy.ai, Tripo3D, Rodin, Unity AI Assistant) and generate prompts including:
- Asset name, art style, gameplay purpose
- Polygon budget, texture resolution, PBR maps needed
- Animation-ready flag, scale reference
- Unity import settings (scale factor, normals, animation type, material handling)

#### Texture & 2D Asset Prompts

Recommend tools (Leonardo.ai, Midjourney, DALLÂ·E, Unity AI Assistant) and generate prompts including:
- Texture type (seamless tile, sprite, UI element, concept art)
- Resolution, style, tiling requirements, PBR maps
- Unity import settings (texture type, filter mode, compression, max size)

#### Music Prompts

Recommend tools (Suno, Soundraw, Sonauto) and generate prompts including:
- Track name, scene context, mood, tempo (BPM), duration

## Best Practices

- âœ… **Start with the core loop** â€” Nail the 30-second cycle before anything else
- âœ… **Profile before optimizing** â€” Use Unity Profiler to find real bottlenecks
- âœ… **Use ScriptableObjects for data** â€” Decouple data from logic for flexibility
- âœ… **Generate multiple AI asset variations** â€” Pick the best from 3â€“5 generations
- âœ… **Test on real devices early** â€” Emulators miss platform-specific issues
- âœ… **Version control from day one** â€” Git + LFS, commit often
- âŒ **Don't hardcode tool choices** â€” Always present alternatives to the user
- âŒ **Don't skip the GDD** â€” Even solo projects benefit from written design
- âŒ **Don't optimize prematurely** â€” Make it work, make it right, make it fast
- âŒ **Don't ship AI assets without review** â€” Check licensing terms for each tool

## Limitations

- This skill does not replace environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- AI-generated assets require legal review for commercial usage rights per each tool's Terms of Service.
- Performance budgets are guidelines â€” always profile on actual target hardware.
- AI tools and their capabilities evolve rapidly â€” verify current availability and pricing before recommending.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## Security & Safety Notes

- This skill does not include shell commands, network fetches, or credential handling.
- All AI tool recommendations are external services; the skill does not execute API calls or store tokens.
- Asset generation prompts are text-only guidance â€” no automated downloads or file mutations occur.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Problem:** User provides a vague idea like "make a game"
  **Solution:** Ask 2â€“3 targeted questions (genre, platform, scope) before generating the first draft

- **Problem:** Scope creep â€” trying to build everything at once
  **Solution:** Use the scope calibration table and feature priority matrix (Must/Should/Could/Won't)

- **Problem:** AI-generated assets don't match the art style
  **Solution:** Always include the GDD's art direction keywords in every asset prompt for consistency

- **Problem:** Performance issues on target platform
  **Solution:** Set platform-specific budgets early and profile against them weekly
