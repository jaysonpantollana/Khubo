# CrossFrame Critical



## When to Use This Skill

- Use only when the user explicitly names `crossframe-critical`, `$crossframe-critical`, or asks to test this critical parallel skill.
- Use for Chinese structural critique dossiers, critique matrices, article plans, and long-form critical essays.
- Do not include it in the default `crossframe-suite` route.

## Packaged Source Note

This AAS-ready copy preserves the original CrossFrame skill body below. Chinese remains the canonical semantic layer; English metadata is only for discovery, installation, and repository review.

## Limitations

- The skill body is intentionally Chinese-canonical; English metadata is for discovery and does not replace the original Chinese terms.
- Use only after explicit CrossFrame invocation or `crossframe-suite` routing; do not apply it as a generic default reasoning layer.
- It structures analysis, drafting, and review, but does not replace source verification, domain expertise, or legal, medical, or financial judgment.

This is a parallel local test skill. It does not replace `crossframe`, `crossframe-essay`, `crossframe-public`, or `crossframe-suite`.

## Position

`crossframe-critical` writes critical Chinese essays that first use CrossFrame to establish structure, evidence boundaries, scale, mechanism candidates, and judgment grade, then sharpen the output into critique.

The critique may absorb Marxist problem awareness: interests, cost transfer, alienation, commodification, ideology, naturalized domination, and reproduction of conditions. It must not mechanically force every topic into class/capital language.

## Required Reading

On every trigger, read:

1. `../crossframe/SKILL.md`
2. `../crossframe/references/read-routing-map.md`
3. If the critique touches high-responsibility, public, AI/process artifact, lifecycle, trapped-subject, or article-output scenarios, reuse `../crossframe/templates/read-state-capsule.md` as `v5-read-state-capsule` and run `../crossframe/worksheets/source-anchor-integrity-check.md`; if the capsule is missing, return to `../crossframe/SKILL.md` instead of inventing source routing here.
4. `protocols/critical-article-protocol.md`
5. `references/critical-matrix.md`
6. `references/example-and-evidence-rules.md`
7. è‹¥æ¶‰åŠçœŸå®žå…¬å…±å¯¹è±¡ã€æœ€æ–°äº‹å®žã€æœºæž„ã€å¹³å°ã€æ”¿ç­–ã€äººç‰©ã€å…¬å¸ã€æ•°æ®ã€AI/è¿‡ç¨‹æ€§äº§ç‰©æˆ–å¼ºåˆ¤æ–­ï¼Œè¯»å– `../crossframe/references/source-ledger-workflow.md` å¹¶å»ºç«‹æ¥æºå°è´¦ã€‚
8. `templates/critical-output-template.md`

If the topic needs long-form style control, also read `../crossframe-essay/SKILL.md` and reuse only its article discipline, not its whole output contract.

## Workflow

1. Build the CrossFrame base: object, fact boundary, scale window, mechanism candidates, judgment grade, and evidence gaps.
2. Apply the critical matrix: cost chain, benefit chain, power/resource distribution, concept concealment, reproduction mechanism, weak signals, and counterconditions.
3. Plan the article: central thesis, reader position, examples, section sequence, word allocation, and ending aftertaste.
4. Write the full essay from the dossier. Default body length is 1800-2800 Chinese characters unless the user overrides it.
5. Run a final boundary check: no personality judgment, no hat-labeling, no conspiracy claim, no unverified strong judgment, no slogan replacing analysis.

## Output

Default output has exactly three visible sections:

```text
# æ‰¹åˆ¤åº•ç¨¿
# ç¯‡ç« æ–¹æ¡ˆ
# æ­£æ–‡
```

Do not collapse the result into a short answer, checklist, memo, or diagnosis summary unless the user explicitly asks for that.

## Hard Rules

- Start from CrossFrame structure, then become critical; do not begin from indignation and decorate it with structure words.
- Critique mechanisms, interests, rhetoric, institutions, and responsibility chains; do not turn structural critique into personal condemnation.
- A real or recent public event requires source checking before factual claims, with a visible source ledger summary. Unverified examples must be labeled as analogy, hypothesis, or common pattern.
- Use at least two concrete examples in the essay body unless the user provides a single narrowly bounded case and asks not to expand.
- Include at least one countercondition, evidence gap, or withdrawal condition.
- Do not use Marxist terms as prestige vocabulary. If a term cannot be translated into who pays, who benefits, what is hidden, and how the condition repeats, remove it.
